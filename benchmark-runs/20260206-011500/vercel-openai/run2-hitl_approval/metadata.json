(file paths, folders, database name, cloud service, etc.)  \n2) Where is it located? (local machine, server, Google Drive, AWS S3, database, etc.)  \n3) Do you have a backup or are you sure you want this permanently removed? Deletions may be irreversible.  \n4) Any time constraints or dependencies I should know about?\n\nIf you understand the consequences and want me to proceed, please confirm by typing one of these exact confirmation phrases (choose one and include the description from #1):\n- CONFIRM DELETE: [exact description]  \nor  \n- YES, DELETE: [exact description]\n\nOnce I receive that exact confirmation I will proceed with clear step-by-step deletion instructions or next steps."
