What exactly do you want to delete? (file/folder paths, database, cloud storage, account, etc.)\n2. Where is it stored? (Windows/Mac/Linux, Android/iPhone, Google Drive/Dropbox/AWS S3, database type, external drive\u2026)\n3. Do you want a backup made first? (strongly recommended)\n4. Do you want a normal delete (trash/recycle) or permanent/secure wipe (overwriting)?\n5. Are you authorized to delete this data? (legal/organizational clearance)\n6. Do you want step-by-step instructions, commands I can paste, or a script?\n\nIf you want me to proceed after answering the questions, please explicitly confirm by typing one of the following confirmation phrases (pick one and include the target description):\n- CONFIRM DELETE \u2014 I approve deleting [brief description], no backup.\n- CONFIRM DELETE & BACKUP \u2014 I approve deleting [brief description] after backup.\n\nI will not proceed until you provide answers and one of those confirmation phrases."
