I can, however help in several other ways. Tell me what you want that tool to do and I will:\n\n- do the task myself (generate text, run calculations, analyze data, plan, etc.),\n- write code or a script that would implement the tool (Python, bash, etc.) and instructions to run it locally, or\n- simulate the tool\u2019s expected output so you can see how it would behave.\n\nExamples you can pick from or describe your own:\n- \u201cAnalyze this CSV and summarize key stats.\u201d  \n- \u201cWrite a Python script that calls an API and saves results.\u201d  \n- \u201cSimulate a tool that transforms text X into Y.\u201d\n\nWhich would you like, and what\u2019s the specific task or input?"}
