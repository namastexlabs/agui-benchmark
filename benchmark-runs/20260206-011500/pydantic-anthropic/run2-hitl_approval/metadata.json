If you need to delete important data, you'll need to:\n\n1. **Do it yourself** directly through your operating system, applications, or services\n2. **Be very careful** - make sure you have backups first!\n3. **Double-check** what you're deleting before confirming the action\n\nIf you need help with something else like math calculations or checking the time, I'm happy to assist! \ud83d\ude0a"
