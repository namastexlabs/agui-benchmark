I have no connection to your files or personal information.\n\nIf you're looking to delete important data from your own computer or accounts, that's something you would do directly through your device or service provider. For any critical deletions, it's always a good practice to:\n1. **Back up your data first** if there's any chance you might need it\n2. **Double-check what you're deleting**\n3. **Verify you're deleting the right thing** before confirming\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like doing a calculation or telling you the current time?"
