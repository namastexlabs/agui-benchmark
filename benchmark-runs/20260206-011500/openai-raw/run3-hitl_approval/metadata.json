What exactly do you want deleted? (file/folder names, database/table names, device, cloud account, etc.)\n2. Where is the data located? (local machine path, server/hostname, cloud provider and bucket/container, app name)\n3. Do you want permanent secure deletion or just move to trash/archive? (permanent irreversible overwrite vs. recoverable)\n4. Do you have a backup or do you want me to provide steps to make one first?\n5. Do you have the necessary permissions/access to perform deletion, or do you want instructions/commands for an admin?\n6. Any legal/privacy/ownership concerns I should know about?\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to proceed, type the exact confirmation phrase below (replace [description] with the short description of the items above):\n\nI confirm permanent deletion of: [description]\n\nI will take no destructive action until I receive that exact confirmation. What would you like to delete?"
