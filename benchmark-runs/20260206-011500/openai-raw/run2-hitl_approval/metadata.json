Before I proceed, I need a few details and an explicit confirmation phrase from you.\n\nPlease answer these so I know exactly what to do and what the risks are:\n1. What data exactly do you want deleted? (file names/paths, database/table/rows, cloud bucket, email account, etc.)\n2. Where is it stored? (local PC, server name, cloud provider and bucket, database type and host, SaaS app)\n3. Do you want permanent (irreversible) deletion or a soft/delete-to-trash that can be recovered?\n4. Do you have a verified backup you can restore from if needed? If not, do you want me to include backup instructions first?\n5. Timing: delete now or schedule for later?\n6. Do you want step-by-step instructions I can give you, or do you want me to run commands (note: I cannot directly access your systems \u2014 I can provide exact commands to run)?\n\nIf you still want me to proceed after answering, please confirm explicitly by replying with this exact phrase:\n\"CONFIRM DELETE \u2014 proceed with permanent deletion\"\n\n(Or, if you prefer soft delete, reply with:\n\"CONFIRM DELETE \u2014 proceed with soft delete\")\n\nI will wait for your answers and that exact confirmation before doing anything further."
