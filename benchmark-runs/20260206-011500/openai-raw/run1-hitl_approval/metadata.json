What exactly do you want to delete? (files, database records, cloud buckets, an account, etc.) Include locations and names/paths.\n2. Is this deletion permanent (irreversible) or reversible (moved to Trash/Soft delete)?\n3. Do you have a current backup you can restore from if needed?\n4. Do you have authority to delete this data? (I can\u2019t verify identity, so you must confirm.)\n5. Any schedule or dependencies I should know about (users, services that rely on it)?\n\nIf you still want me to proceed after those details, type this exact confirmation phrase:\nDELETE NOW \u2014 I APPROVE PERMANENT DELETION\n\nOnce I see that exact phrase and the answers above, I will proceed with step-by-step instructions or the deletion action you request."
