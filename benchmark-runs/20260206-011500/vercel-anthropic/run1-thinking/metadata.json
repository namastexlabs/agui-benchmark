We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:\n- x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n**Step 3: Simplify**\n- x = 7\n\n**Step 4: Verify the answer**\nLet me check this using the calculator:Perfect! \u2713\n\n**Answer: x = 7**\n\n**Reasoning:** We used the principle that whatever operation we do to one side of an equation, we must do to the other side to keep it balanced. By subtracting 5 from both sides, we isolated x and found that x equals 7. We verified this by substituting 7 back into the original equation: 7 + 5 = 12 \u2713"
