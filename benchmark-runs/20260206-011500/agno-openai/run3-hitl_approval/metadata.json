Before we proceed, I need a few details and I\u2019ll show a clear confirmation step you must give.\n\n1) Quick clarifying questions\n- What exactly do you want deleted? (file(s), folder, database, VM, cloud bucket, user account, etc.)\n- Where is it located? (local PC, Windows/macOS/Linux, company server, AWS/Azure/GCP, Dropbox/Google Drive, etc.)\n- Is there any backup you want kept (or created) first?\n- Do you need a secure/irreversible wipe (overwriting) or a normal delete/trash?\n- Are there any legal, compliance, or business owners I should be aware of?\n- Do you want me to provide step-by-step commands/instructions, or do you want me to run the deletion (note: I can\u2019t directly access your systems unless you provide a connected tool; I can only guide you)?\n\n2) Risks and recommendations (read before approving)\n- Deletion may be irreversible. Secure wipes are usually unrecoverable.\n- Make a backup if you might need the data later.\n- Check for dependencies (apps, services, users) that rely on the data.\n- If this is production/business data, notify stakeholders and ensure compliance.\n\n3) Proposed plan (example \u2014 I\u2019ll adapt after your answers)\n- I will list the exact items to be deleted and the commands/steps I propose.\n- You review and confirm.\n- You reply with the exact approval phrase: CONFIRM DELETE \u2014 then I\u2019ll provide/execute the deletion instructions you requested.\n\nPlease answer the clarifying questions and tell me which plan you prefer. When you\u2019re ready, give the approval phrase exactly: CONFIRM DELETE. I will wait for that before proceeding."
