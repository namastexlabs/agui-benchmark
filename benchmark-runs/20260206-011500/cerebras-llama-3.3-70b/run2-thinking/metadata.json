Our goal is to get x alone on the left side. To do this, we need to get rid of the +5. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation. This keeps the equation balanced.\n\n3. So, we subtract 5 from both sides: x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n4. Simplifying both sides, we get: x = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
