Exactly which data should be deleted? (Give file names, folders, database/table names, or paths and the system where it lives.)\n2. Where is the data stored? (Local machine, cloud provider and bucket, specific server, database name, etc.)\n3. Do you have a backup? If not, do you want me to create one or recommend one before deletion?\n4. Is deletion irreversible (permanent delete) or do you want it moved to a recycle/trash/archive first?\n5. When should the deletion occur? (Now or scheduled time.)\n6. Type the exact confirmation phrase you want me to require before proceeding (for example: DELETE NOW, or I CONFIRM DELETE of [description]). I will refuse to proceed unless you send that exact phrase.\n\nReply with the answers and the confirmation phrase. I will not take any deletion action until I receive that exact phrase."
