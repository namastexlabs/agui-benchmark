    "final_text": "To find the value of x in the equation x + 5 = 12, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the equation**: The equation is x + 5 = 12, which means x added to 5 equals 12.\n\n2. **Identify the goal**: My goal is to isolate x, which means I need to find the value of x by itself.\n\n3. **Subtract 5 from both sides**: To isolate x, I can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the +5 on the left side of the equation.\n\n4. **Perform the subtraction**: \n   x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n   x = 7\n\nSo, the value of x in the equation x + 5 = 12 is 7.\n\nHere's a simple way to verify the result:\n- If x = 7, then x + 5 = 7 + 5 = 12, which is true.\n- Therefore, the value of x in the equation x + 5 = 12 is indeed 7."
