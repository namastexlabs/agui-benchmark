Our goal is to isolate x, which means we need to get rid of the +5 on the left side of the equation.\n3. To do this, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This is a common technique to isolate the variable.\n\n   x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n   By subtracting 5 from both sides, we are effectively canceling out the +5 on the left side.\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   x = 7\n\n   Now, the equation is simplified, and we have isolated x.\n\n5. Therefore, the value of x is 7."
