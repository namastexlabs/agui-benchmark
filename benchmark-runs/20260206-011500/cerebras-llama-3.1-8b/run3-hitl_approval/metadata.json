What type of data do you need to delete (e.g., files, documents, emails, database entries)?\n2. Are you aware of the consequences of deleting this data (e.g., irretrievable loss, impact on future operations)?\n3. Have you considered backup options (e.g., saving a copy, archiving the data)?\n\nPlease provide me with the answers to these questions, and I will proceed with your approval.\n\n**Please note that once deleted, the data will be irretrievable.**"
