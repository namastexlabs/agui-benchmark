Before we continue I need a few details and an explicit confirmation from you.\n\n1) Tell me:\n- Exactly what data you want deleted (files, folders, databases, S3 buckets, specific records, etc.).\n- Where it\u2019s located (local machine path, server, cloud provider and bucket/region, database name/table, etc.).\n- Whether you want permanent deletion or to move the data to an archive/trash for recovery.\n\n2) Warnings and safety:\n- Deletions can be irreversible. Do you have a backup or snapshot? If not, I recommend creating one first.\n- If this is production data, confirm downtime windows or any dependent services.\n\n3) How I\u2019ll proceed once you confirm:\n- I can (a) give you exact commands and step-by-step instructions to run, or (b) if you want me to perform actions (via automation you provide), I will only proceed after you send the explicit confirmation phrase below.\n\nPlease confirm using this exact phrase (copy/paste, case-sensitive) so I know you really approve:\n    I confirm permanent deletion of: [brief description of data and location]\n\nReplace [brief description of data and location] with what you specified in (1). After I receive that exact phrase I\u2019ll proceed with the deletion plan you requested (or provide the commands if you asked for them)."
