Whether you have a backup or want me to make one first.  \n4. Whether you want a normal delete (trash/recoverable) or a permanent/secure overwrite.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, give explicit approval by copying and sending this exact confirmation phrase (replace the bracketed text with the exact data description you provided above):\nYES \u2014 permanently delete: [full description of data and location]\n\nIf you want a non-permanent delete or a backup-first option, reply with one of these exact phrases instead:\n- YES \u2014 move to trash/recycle bin: [full description]  \n- YES \u2014 create backup first, then delete: [full description]\n\nIf you do not want deletion, reply: NO \u2014 do not delete.\n\nTell me the details and then paste the exact confirmation phrase you choose. I\u2019ll wait for that before doing anything."
