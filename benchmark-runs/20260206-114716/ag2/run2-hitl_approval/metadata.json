Exactly what data you want deleted (files, folders, databases, email, which paths or service names).  \n2. Where it\u2019s stored (local machine, specific server, cloud provider and bucket/container, database name, etc.).  \n3. Whether you have a backup or want help creating one.  \n4. That you understand deletion may be irreversible.\n\nIf you\u2019re ready, confirm by typing a clear approval like:\n\"I approve deletion of [brief description of the data].\"\n\nOnce you provide the details and that explicit approval phrase, I\u2019ll proceed with instructions or actions (if I have the access) as you request. Do you want help making a backup first?"
