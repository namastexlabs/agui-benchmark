What exactly do you want deleted? (file names, folders, databases, cloud buckets, devices)\n2. Where is it stored? (local PC \u2014 Windows/macOS/Linux, external drive, Google Drive, Dropbox, AWS S3, Azure, database server, other)\n3. Do you want permanent deletion (irreversible) or move to Trash/Recycle Bin first?\n4. Do you have a backup that you\u2019re willing to keep, or should I include steps to create one first?\n5. Are there any legal/organizational retention rules I should know about?\n6. Do you prefer GUI steps or terminal/command-line commands?\n7. Confirm you are the owner/authorized person for this data.\n\nIf you still want me to proceed after I give the deletion steps, please explicitly approve by typing one of the exact confirmation phrases below (copy-paste one):\n\n- For irreversible deletion: I CONFIRM PERMANENT DELETE of [brief description]\n- For move-to-trash first: I APPROVE MOVE TO TRASH of [brief description]\n\nReplace [brief description] with a short label for the data (e.g., \u201c/home/alex/old-project\u201d or \u201cS3 bucket my-company-backups\u201d). I will not provide or execute deletion steps until I receive one of these exact confirmations."
