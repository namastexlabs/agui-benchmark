Looking at my available functions, I can only:\n- **Tell you the current time**\n- **Perform basic math calculations**\n\nI have no ability to access, modify, or delete files, databases, emails, or any other data on your system or elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking to delete important data, you'll need to:\n1. Use your operating system's file manager or application directly\n2. Contact your IT department or system administrator\n3. Use the appropriate software or service where that data is stored\n\n**Always make sure to:**\n- Back up important data before deletion\n- Verify you're deleting the correct items\n- Follow your organization's data retention policies\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with, like doing a calculation or checking the time?"
