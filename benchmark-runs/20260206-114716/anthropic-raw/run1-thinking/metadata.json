Since x is being added to 5, I'll subtract 5 from both sides:\n- x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n- x = 7\n\n**Step 3: Verify the answer**\nLet me check this is correct by substituting x = 7 back into the original equation:Perfect! \u2713\n\n**Answer: x = 7**\n\nThe reasoning is straightforward: whatever operation is applied to x, we undo it by doing the opposite operation to both sides of the equation. Since 5 was added to x, we subtracted 5 from both sides to isolate x."
