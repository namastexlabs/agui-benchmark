The equation given is x + 5 = 12. \n\nWe can start by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation to get x by itself. This is because if we add 5 to x to get 12, we can reverse this operation by subtracting 5.\n\nSo, x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\nThis simplifies to x = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7.To find the value of x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation.
