Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Start with the given equation**: x + 5 = 12\n2. **Our goal is to get x alone on the left side of the equation. To do this, we need to get rid of the +5. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation. This will keep the equation balanced.\n\nSo, subtract 5 from both sides: x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n1. **Simplify both sides of the equation**: x = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
