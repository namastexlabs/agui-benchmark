    "final_text": "To solve for x, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Write down the equation**: The equation given is x + 5 = 12.\n\n2. **Identify the goal**: I need to isolate x, which means I need to get x by itself on one side of the equation.\n\n3. **Decide on the operation to isolate x**: Since 5 is being added to x, I will do the opposite operation to isolate x. The opposite of addition is subtraction.\n\n4. **Apply the operation to both sides**: To keep the equation balanced, I will subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. \n\n   So, I will subtract 5 from x + 5 and also subtract 5 from 12.\n\n5. **Perform the subtraction**:\n   - Subtracting 5 from x + 5 gives me x (because x + 5 - 5 = x).\n   - Subtracting 5 from 12 gives me 7 (because 12 - 5 = 7).\n\n6. **Write down the result**: After performing the subtraction, my equation becomes x = 7.\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
