Our goal is to isolate x, so let's start by looking at the addition operation (+5) that is currently added to x. To get rid of this addition, we need to subtract 5 from both sides of the equation.\n\n   x + 5 = 12\n\n   Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us:\n   x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n   Simplifying the equation gives us:\n   x = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
