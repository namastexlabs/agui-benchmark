    "final_text": "To find the value of x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with the given equation: x + 5 = 12\n\n2. The goal is to get x by itself on one side. To do this, we need to get rid of the +5 on the same side as x. \n\n3. We can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to achieve this. When we subtract 5 from the left side, it cancels out the +5. When we subtract 5 from the right side, it also affects the number 12.\n\n4. The equation becomes: x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n5. Simplify both sides of the equation by performing the subtraction. On the left side, the +5 and -5 cancel each other out, leaving x. On the right side, 12 minus 5 is 7.\n\n6. The simplified equation is: x = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
