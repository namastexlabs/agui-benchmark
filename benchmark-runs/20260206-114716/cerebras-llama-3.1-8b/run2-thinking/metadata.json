Our goal is to isolate x, meaning we want x alone on one side of the equation.\n\n3. To do this, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the +5 on the left side, leaving us with just x.\n\n4. The equation now becomes: x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 7\n\n6. Therefore, the value of x is 7."
