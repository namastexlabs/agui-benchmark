(local PC, external drive, server/VM, cloud storage like S3, database, etc.)\n2. Exactly what should be deleted? (file paths, bucket name, database/table name, user account, etc.)\n3. Do you have a current backup or snapshot? Do you want a backup made first?\n4. Any legal, compliance, or recovery concerns I should know about?\n5. Do you want irreversible deletion (secure overwrite/shred) or just removal to trash/recycle?\n\nIf you understand the deletion is potentially irreversible, reply with one of these confirmations:\n- \u201cI APPROVE \u2014 proceed and provide deletion steps\u201d (I\u2019ll give the exact commands and safety checks),\n- or \u201cI APPROVE \u2014 proceed and execute\u201d (I cannot execute actions myself, I will still only provide commands).\n\nI\u2019ll wait for your answers and explicit approval before giving deletion instructions."
