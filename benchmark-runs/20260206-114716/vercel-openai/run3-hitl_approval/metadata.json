Before I proceed, please provide these details and confirm:\n\n1) What exactly will be deleted (files, database rows, cloud bucket, etc.)?  \n2) Where it\u2019s located (file path, server, service and account, database name/table).  \n3) Do you have a current backup? If not, do you want instructions to create one first?  \n4) Do you want permanent deletion (irreversible) or a soft/archive/delete-to-recycle-bin option?  \n5) When should the deletion occur? Now or scheduled?\n\nWarning: permanent deletion can be irreversible. If this is critical data, I strongly recommend creating a backup before proceeding.\n\nIf you still want me to continue, please confirm by typing one of these exact phrases so I don\u2019t act on an accidental reply:\n- For permanent deletion: CONFIRM DELETE PERMANENT  \n- For soft-delete/archive: CONFIRM DELETE SOFT\n\nAfter you send the exact confirmation phrase and the details above, I\u2019ll either (a) give step-by-step deletion commands/instructions, or (b) proceed with any deletion steps you\u2019ve asked me to perform \u2014 but only after I receive that exact confirmation. Which data are we deleting?"
