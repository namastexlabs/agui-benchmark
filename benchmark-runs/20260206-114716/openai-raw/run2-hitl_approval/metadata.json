Can you confirm you want this data deleted permanently (irreversible) or just moved to trash/archived?\n2. Where is the data located? (local machine: Windows/macOS/Linux \u2014 give full paths; or cloud: Google Drive, Dropbox, AWS S3, Azure Blob, database, etc.)\n3. Do you have backups or snapshots you may want preserved?\n4. Do you want secure/forensic-safe erasure (e.g., shred/wipe) or a normal delete?\n5. Do you want me to provide commands/scripts, step-by-step UI instructions, or both?\n\nWarning: permanent deletion can be irreversible. I cannot access your systems to delete anything directly \u2014 I will only provide instructions or code for you to run.\n\nIf you understand and want me to proceed, reply with the exact confirmation phrase below and include the details requested above:\n\nCONFIRM DELETE \u2014 permanently delete the data described: [paste paths/locations and choices]\n\nOnce I receive that phrase and the details, I will provide the deletion steps (and again ask for final approval before giving any destructive command)."
