    "final_text": "To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\nGiven equation: x + 5 = 12\n\nStep 1: Identify the constant term that needs to be isolated from 'x'. In this case, it's the number 5.\n\nStep 2: To isolate 'x', we need to get rid of the constant term 5 on the same side as 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.\n\nSo, the equation becomes: \nx + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\nThis simplifies to: \nx = 7\n\nBy following this process, we have successfully isolated 'x' and found its value."
