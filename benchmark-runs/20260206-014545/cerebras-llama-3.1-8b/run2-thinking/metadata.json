    "final_text": "To find the value of x, follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the given equation: x + 5 = 12\n\n2. The goal is to isolate x (i.e., get x by itself on one side of the equation). To do this, we need to get rid of the 5 that is being added to x.\n\n3. To get rid of the 5, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the +5 on the left side of the equation.\n\n4. Perform the subtraction: x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n5. Simplify both sides of the equation. On the left side, -5 cancels out +5. On the right side, 12 - 5 = 7.\n\n6. The equation now looks like this: x = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
