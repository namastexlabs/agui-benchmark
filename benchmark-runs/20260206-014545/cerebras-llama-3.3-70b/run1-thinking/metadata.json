    "final_text": "To find the value of x, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Start with the given equation**: x + 5 = 12\n2. **My goal is to isolate x**, which means I want to get x all by itself on one side of the equation.\n3. **To isolate x, I need to get rid of the +5 on the same side as x**. To do this, I can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will keep the equation balanced.\n4. **Subtract 5 from both sides**: x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n5. **Simplify the equation**: x = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
