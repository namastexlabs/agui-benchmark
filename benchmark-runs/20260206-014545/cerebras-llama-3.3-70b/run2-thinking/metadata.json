    "final_text": "To solve for x in the equation x + 5 = 12, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. The goal is to isolate x, which means getting x by itself on one side of the equation.\n2. To do this, I'll use the inverse operation of addition, which is subtraction. Since 5 is being added to x, I'll subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to keep it balanced.\n3. The equation is x + 5 = 12. If I subtract 5 from both sides, I get:\n   x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n4. Simplifying both sides gives me:\n   x = 7\n\nSo, the value of x is 7."
