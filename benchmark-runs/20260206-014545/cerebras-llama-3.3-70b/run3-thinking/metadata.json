    "final_text": "To solve for x, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Start with the given equation**: x + 5 = 12\n2. **My goal is to isolate x, which means I want to get x by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, I need to get rid of the +5 on the same side as x.**\n3. **To get rid of the +5, I will subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will keep the equation balanced and allow me to isolate x.**\n4. **Subtract 5 from both sides**: x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n5. **Simplify the equation**: x = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
