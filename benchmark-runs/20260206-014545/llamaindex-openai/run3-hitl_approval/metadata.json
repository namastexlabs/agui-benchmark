Before I prepare a deletion plan or take any action, I need a few details so I can confirm what will be deleted and the risks:\n\nPlease provide:\n1. A clear description of the data to delete (files, database, account, etc.).  \n2. Exact location/service (device path, server, cloud provider, database name, email account, etc.).  \n3. Do you have a backup? If not, do you want me to make one or walk you through making one?  \n4. Any time constraint (when should this be done)?  \n5. Who else (other accounts/people/systems) will be affected?  \n6. Any compliance/privacy/legal concerns I should know about?\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to proceed, reply with the exact confirmation phrase below (replace <description> with the short data description you gave above):\nI APPROVE \u2014 delete <description> now\n\nI will not proceed with any deletion until I receive that exact confirmation phrase. Would you like me to draft a safe deletion plan now (including backup and rollback steps) based on the details above?"
