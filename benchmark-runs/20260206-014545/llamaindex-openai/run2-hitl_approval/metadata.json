Do you want me to:\n   - A) provide step-by-step instructions or deletion commands you will run, or\n   - B) perform deletions for you (note: I can only perform deletions if you run provided commands or grant a remote session; I cannot access your devices on my own).\n4. To confirm you understand and approve, type one of these exact approval phrases (choose and include the data description from item 1):\n   - I APPROVE: delete [exact data description]\n   - CONFIRM DELETE: delete [exact data description]\n\nI will not proceed until you reply with the exact approval phrase and the answers above. I also recommend making a backup now if you haven\u2019t already."
