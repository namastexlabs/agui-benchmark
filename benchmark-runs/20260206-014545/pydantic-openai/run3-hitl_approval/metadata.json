Exactly which data you want deleted (files, accounts, database rows, etc.).\n2. Where it\u2019s stored (local device, external drive, cloud provider and service, specific server).\n3. Whether you have a backup or want me to show how to make one.\n4. Whether you want permanent deletion (irreversible) or just move to trash/recycle bin.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve answered, confirm you want me to proceed by replying with a clear approval phrase, for example:\n- \"Yes \u2014 permanently delete the specified data\"\nor\n- \"Yes \u2014 move to trash, do not permanently delete.\"\n\nI will not take any deletion steps until I receive that explicit approval."
