Where it\u2019s stored (local Windows/Mac/Linux machine, Google Drive, Dropbox, AWS S3, Azure, MySQL/Postgres, etc.).\n3. Whether you have backups or snapshots and whether those should also be removed.\n4. The deletion method you want (move to trash/recycle bin, permanent delete, secure overwrite, purge backups/snapshots).\n5. Any legal/organization/ownership constraints (are you authorized to delete this? any retention policy?).\n6. Whether you want me to (a) provide exact step-by-step commands/instructions you can run, or (b) perform the deletion for you (note: I can only execute actions if you provide appropriate access or run the commands I give).\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, confirm by typing this exact phrase (replace the bracketed text with a brief identifier of the data):\nCONFIRM DELETE \u2014 I AUTHORIZE DELETION OF [short description]\n\nExample:\nCONFIRM DELETE \u2014 I AUTHORIZE DELETION OF /home/alex/old_backups\n\nI will only proceed after I receive that exact confirmation plus the details above."
