Exactly which data to delete (paths, filenames, database/table names, cloud bucket, account, etc.).  \n2. Where it\u2019s stored (local machine, server, cloud provider, service name).  \n3. Scope: permanent wipe or move to trash/recycle bin? Single files or entire directories/databases? Date range?  \n4. Do you have a backup or do you want me to create/export one first?  \n5. Any legal/compliance retention requirements I should know about.  \n6. Preferred deletion method (simple delete, secure overwrite, irreversible purge).\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, confirm by replying with this exact phrase (so I know you approve):  \nI CONFIRM DELETE: [brief description of what to delete] \u2014 [deletion method]\n\nExample: I CONFIRM DELETE: /home/alex/old-project (all files) \u2014 permanent purge\n\nI will not take any deletion steps until I receive that exact confirmation. I also recommend making a backup before deleting anything irreversible."
