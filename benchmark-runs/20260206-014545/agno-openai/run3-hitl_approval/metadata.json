Before we proceed, please provide the following and then give an explicit confirmation phrase so I know you really want the deletion to happen.\n\n1) What exactly to delete (file names/paths, database/table/record IDs, cloud bucket, etc.).  \n2) Where it is located (device, server, cloud provider and region, database host).  \n3) Scope and quantity (single item, folder, whole database, number of records).  \n4) Why you want it deleted and whether you have authority/permission to delete it.  \n5) Do you want a backup/export first? If yes, how/where to save it.  \n6) Any constraints or schedule (do this now or at a later time).  \n7) Confirm you understand deletion may be irreversible and may have legal or operational consequences.\n\nIf you still want me to proceed after that, reply with the exact confirmation phrase:\nI AUTHORIZE PERMANENT DELETE\n\nI will ask for final confirmation once more before taking any deletion steps."
