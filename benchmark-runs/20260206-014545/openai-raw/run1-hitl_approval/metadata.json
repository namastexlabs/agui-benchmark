(e.g., local Windows/Mac/Linux machine, external drive, AWS S3, Google Drive, Dropbox, SQL database, server, etc.)  \n2) Exactly what should be deleted? Give full paths, filenames, bucket/object names, or database/table/row IDs.  \n3) Do you want a reversible delete (move to Trash/Recycle Bin) or permanent secure erase?  \n4) Do you have a backup or do you want instructions to make one first?  \n5) Any time constraints or required logging/audit trail?\n\nI will only proceed after you explicitly approve. To confirm, please reply with a single line in this exact format:\n\nCONFIRM DELETE \u2014 [short description of what to delete and where]\n\nExample: CONFIRM DELETE \u2014 /home/alice/work/projectX (permanent)\n\nAfter I receive that confirmation I will (before performing any destructive step) either:\n- give exact commands and a step-by-step plan you can run, or\n- if you grant me remote access (please note: I cannot access your systems unless you set up and give me access through a supported integration), describe how to perform the deletion securely.\n\nTell me the answers above and then send the CONFIRM DELETE line when you\u2019re ready."
