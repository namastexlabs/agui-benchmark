I can\u2019t call tools that don\u2019t exist, but I can help in a few ways \u2014 pick one:\n\n- If you meant a real action, tell me what you want done and I\u2019ll either do it with available tools or simulate it.\n- I can call the available tools here: get_current_time (returns current date/time) and calculator (evaluate math expressions). I can also run them in parallel.\n- I can write code or pseudo-code that would use a hypothetical tool, or show how to integrate an external API/service you name.\n\nExamples \u2014 tell me which you want and I\u2019ll run it:\n- \u201cGet the current time.\u201d\n- \u201cCompute 12345 * 6789.\u201d\n- \u201cDo both at once.\u201d\n\nOr describe what \u201cnonexistent_tool\u201d was supposed to do and I\u2019ll implement the behavior using available tools or a simulation. Which do you want?"
