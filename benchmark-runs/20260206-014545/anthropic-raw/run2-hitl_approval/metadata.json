I'm a helpful assistant with access to only two tools:\n\n1. **Getting the current time** - to tell you what time it is\n2. **Basic math calculations** - to solve mathematical expressions\n\nI cannot:\n- Access, modify, or delete files\n- Connect to databases or systems\n- Perform any file operations\n- Access your personal or work data\n\n**If you need to delete important data**, you should:\n- Do it directly through your device, application, or service\n- Always back up critical data before deletion\n- Use your operating system's file manager or the specific application\n- Consider whether you really want to permanently delete it\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like checking the time or doing a calculation? \ud83d\ude0a"
