I'm designed to be safe and limited in what I can do.\n\nIf you're looking to delete important data from your own system, you would need to:\n1. Use your operating system's file manager or appropriate application\n2. Ensure you have proper backups before deletion\n3. Make sure you're deleting the correct files\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like a math calculation or checking the time?"
