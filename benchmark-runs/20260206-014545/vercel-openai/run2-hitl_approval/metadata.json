(local machine, Linux server, Windows, cloud storage like S3, database, etc.)\n2. Exact items/paths to delete (or an example). Be specific \u2014 I will only act on what you specify.\n3. Do you have a backup or snapshot? Should I create one or show how to before deleting?\n4. Do you want a dry-run (list what would be deleted) or immediate permanent deletion?\n5. How would you like me to perform the deletion: show shell/SQL/console commands for you to run, or a script you can run?\n\nIf you want me to proceed after you answer the above, please confirm explicitly by typing one of these exact phrases (so I know it\u2019s intentional):\n- \u201cYES \u2014 Delete the specified data now\u201d\nor\n- \u201cYES \u2014 Show me deletion commands (I will run them)\u201d\n\nI will wait for your answers and that explicit confirmation before doing anything."
