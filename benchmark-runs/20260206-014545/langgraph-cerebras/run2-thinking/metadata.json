The given equation is x + 5 = 12. \n\nFirst, we want to get x by itself, so we need to remove the +5 from the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation. \n\nSo, x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5. This simplifies to x = 7.\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7.To find the value of x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation.
