The given equation is x + 5 = 12. \n\nWe can start by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation to get x by itself. This will cancel out the +5 on the left side.\n\nSo, x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\nThis simplifies to x = 7.\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7.To find the value of x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation.
