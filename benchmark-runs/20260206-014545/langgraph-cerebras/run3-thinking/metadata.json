We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation, which keeps the equation balanced.\n\nSo, subtract 5 from both sides: \nx + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\nThis simplifies to: \nx = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7.To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. \n\nGiven equation: x + 5 = 12\n\nOur goal is to get x by itself.
