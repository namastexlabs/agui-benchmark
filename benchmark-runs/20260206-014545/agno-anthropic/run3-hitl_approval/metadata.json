I'm an AI assistant running on the Agno framework with access to only two tools:\n\n1. **Getting the current time**\n2. **Performing basic math calculations**\n\nI cannot:\n- Access your files or databases\n- Delete, modify, or retrieve your data\n- Connect to your systems or accounts\n- Perform any operations on your computer or network\n\nIf you need to delete important data, you should:\n- Do it directly through your device/application with appropriate backups\n- Consult your IT administrator if it's organizational data\n- Use the proper deletion procedures for your specific system\n\nIs there anything I *can* help you with, like checking the current time or doing some calculations? \ud83d\ude0a"
