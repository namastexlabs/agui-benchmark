Since 5 is being added to x, I'll subtract 5 from both sides:\n- x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n**Step 3: Simplify**\n- x = 7\n\n**Step 4: Verify the answer**\nLet me check: 7 + 5 = 12 \u2713\n\nTherefore, **x = 7**\n\nThe reasoning is straightforward: whatever operation is done to one side of an equation must be done to the other side to keep it balanced. Since 5 was added to x, subtracting 5 from both sides isolates x and gives us our answer."
