I can't interact with your computer, cloud storage, or any other data systems.\n\nIf you're looking to delete data from your own system, you would need to do that directly through:\n- Your file manager or operating system\n- Your cloud service provider (Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.)\n- Your application's settings\n- Your database management tool\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like calculations or checking the time?"
