I can't access files, databases, or any data storage systems.\n\nIf you're looking to delete important data, you'll need to:\n1. Use your operating system's file manager, or\n2. Access the specific application or service where that data is stored, or\n3. Contact your system administrator if it's on a company system\n\n**Important reminder:** Before deleting any important data, I'd strongly recommend:\n- Creating a backup copy first\n- Double-checking you're deleting the right files\n- Verifying you won't need that data in the future\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like doing a calculation or checking the time?"
