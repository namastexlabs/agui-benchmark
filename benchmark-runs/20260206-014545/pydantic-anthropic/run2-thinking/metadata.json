I can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides:\n- x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n- x = 7\n\n**Step 3: Verify the answer**\nLet me check by substituting x = 7 back into the original equation:Perfect! \u2713\n\n**Answer: x = 7**\n\n**Reasoning:** To solve for x, we used the principle that whatever operation we do to one side of an equation, we must do to the other side to keep it balanced. Since 5 was being added to x, we subtracted 5 from both sides, which gave us x = 7. We verified this is correct since 7 + 5 = 12."
