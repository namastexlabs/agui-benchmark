I can't delete, modify, or remove anything from your computer or any online service.\n\nIf you're looking to delete important data, you'll need to do that directly through:\n- Your file manager or operating system\n- Your email or cloud storage provider\n- Your database or application software\n- Other services where that data is stored\n\n**Important tip:** Before deleting important data, I'd recommend:\n1. Creating a backup copy first\n2. Double-checking that you really want to delete it\n3. Verifying you're deleting the correct files/data\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like calculations or checking the time?"
