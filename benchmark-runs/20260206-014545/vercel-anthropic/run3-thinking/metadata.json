We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation (whatever we do to one side, we must do to the other to keep the equation balanced).\n\nx + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n**Step 3: Simplify**\nx = 12 - 5\n\nLet me calculate that:**Answer: x = 7**\n\n**Verification:** Let's check our answer by substituting x = 7 back into the original equation:\n7 + 5 = 12 \u2713\n\nThis confirms our answer is correct!"
