Since 5 is being added to x, I need to subtract 5 from both sides:\n- x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n**Step 3: Simplify both sides**\nLet me calculate this:**Step 4: Solution**\nx = 7\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me check this is correct by substituting x = 7 back into the original equation:\u2713 Correct! When x = 7, we get 7 + 5 = 12, which matches our original equation.\n\n**Answer: x = 7**\u2713 Correct! When x = 7, we get 7 + 5 = 12, which matches our original equation.\n\n**Answer: x = 7**"
