I'll do this by removing the \"+5\" from the left side.\n\n**Step 3: Subtract 5 from both sides**\nWhen we subtract 5 from both sides, we maintain the equation's balance:\n- x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n- x = 7\n\n**Step 4: Verify the answer**\nLet me check by substituting x = 7 back into the original equation:\u2713 Correct! 7 + 5 = 12\n\n**Answer: x = 7**\n\nThe reasoning process uses the fundamental principle of algebra: whatever operation you perform on one side of an equation, you must perform on the other side to keep it balanced. Since we had x + 5, we subtracted 5 from both sides to isolate x.\u2713 Correct! 7 + 5 = 12\n\n**Answer: x = 7**\n\nThe reasoning process uses the fundamental principle of algebra: whatever operation you perform on one side of an equation, you must perform on the other side to keep it balanced.
