What exactly should be deleted? (filenames, database names/tables, directories, or resource IDs)\n2. Where is the data stored? (local machine, specific server, cloud provider + bucket/container name, database host)\n3. Do you have current backups or snapshots? (yes/no \u2014 where are they)\n4. Should the deletion be permanent (irreversible wipe) or a soft delete (move to trash/mark as deleted)?\n5. Any time constraints or scheduled window for doing this?\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to proceed, please give explicit approval by typing this exact confirmation phrase:\nI APPROVE DELETE\n\nI will wait for that exact phrase before taking any deletion steps or giving step-by-step deletion commands. If you want, I can also recommend a backup checklist and a safe deletion plan first."
