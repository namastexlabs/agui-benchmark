Please answer the short checklist below and then give a clear approval phrase (examples below) before I provide deletion steps or commands.\n\n1) What exactly do you want deleted? (files, database rows, account, cloud bucket, etc.; include names/paths)\n2) Where is it stored? (local machine, specific server, cloud provider and bucket/container, database type)\n3) Scope and time window: delete everything now, or only items older than X, or a subset?\n4) Backup: do you have a verified backup you can restore from? (Yes / No)\n5) Permanence: soft-delete (recoverable) or permanent secure-wipe?\n6) Any legal, compliance, or other stakeholders who must be notified?\n7) Do you want me to (A) provide step-by-step commands/scripts to run, or (B) walk you through interactively?\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, type one of these explicit confirmation phrases (or a similar unmistakable approval):\n- \u201cI approve permanent deletion of [brief description].\u201d\n- \u201cCONFIRM DELETE: [description].\u201d\n- Or simply reply \u201cYES \u2014 delete [description] permanently.\u201d\n\nI will not proceed until I receive one of those confirmations."
