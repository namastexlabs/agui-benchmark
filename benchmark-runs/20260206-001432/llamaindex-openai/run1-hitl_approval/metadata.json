Exactly what data you want deleted (names/paths/IDs) and where it\u2019s stored (device, cloud provider, database, etc.).  \n2. Whether you want permanent deletion or to move it to a recycle/trash/archive first.  \n3. Any backups or legal/regulatory constraints I should know about.  \n4. How you\u2019d like to confirm approval (typing a specific phrase, replying \u201cYES\u201d, etc.).\n\nSuggested approval method (pick one or tell me another):\n- I will present a final summary of the exact items to be deleted and the consequences. To authorize deletion you must reply with this exact phrase: DELETE [exact-data-name] NOW\n(Replace [exact-data-name] with the name shown in the summary.)\n\nIf that works, provide the details in (1\u20133) above and tell me which confirmation method you prefer. I will then prepare the deletion summary and wait for your explicit approval before doing anything."
