    "final_text": "To solve for x, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Start with the given equation**: x + 5 = 12\n2. **My goal is to isolate x**, which means I want to get x all by itself on one side of the equation.\n3. **To do this, I will subtract 5 from both sides of the equation**. This is because whatever I do to one side of the equation, I must do to the other side to keep the equation balanced.\n4. **So, I will subtract 5 from both sides**: x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n5. **Simplifying the equation**, I get: x = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
