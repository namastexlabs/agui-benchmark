    "final_text": "To solve for x, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Write down the equation: x + 5 = 12\n2. My goal is to isolate x, which means I want to get x by itself on one side of the equation.\n3. To do this, I will subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This is because whatever operation I perform on one side of the equation, I must also perform on the other side to keep the equation balanced.\n4. So, I will subtract 5 from both sides: x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n5. Simplify the equation: x = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
