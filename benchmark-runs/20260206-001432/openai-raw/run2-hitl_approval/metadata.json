What exactly do you want deleted? (files/folders, database records, cloud storage, device/drive, account, etc.) Include platform/service and paths or names if you can.  \n2. Do you want permanent deletion (irreversible) or move to trash/archive (recoverable)?  \n3. Do you have a backup or are you sure you do not want one?  \n4. Any legal or compliance constraints I should be aware of?  \n5. Type one of these exact confirmation phrases to proceed:  \n   - \"YES, PERMANENTLY DELETE\" (proceed with irreversible deletion)  \n   - \"YES, MOVE TO TRASH\" (proceed with recoverable deletion)  \n   - \"CANCEL\" (do not delete)\n\nI will wait for your explicit confirmation phrase before giving deletion steps or taking further action."
