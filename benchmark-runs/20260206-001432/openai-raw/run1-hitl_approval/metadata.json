What exactly should be deleted?\n   - File paths, folder names, database/table names, cloud bucket, account, etc.\n2. Where is the data located?\n   - Local machine (OS), server, cloud provider (AWS/GCP/Azure), SaaS app (Dropbox, Google Drive), database type, etc.\n3. Scope and timing\n   - Single item or bulk? Immediate or scheduled? Any required maintenance window?\n4. Deletion type\n   - Soft delete (move to trash/retention) or permanent wipe (irreversible)?\n5. Backups & recovery\n   - Do you have a verified backup? Should I create one before deleting?\n6. Authorization & compliance\n   - Do you have authority to delete this data? Any legal/retention policies to consider?\n7. Anything else to preserve (logs, metadata, related records)?\n\nRecommended precautions (strongly consider):\n- Create and verify a backup before deletion.\n- If possible, perform a test deletion on a small sample first.\n- Use a retention period or soft-delete if recovery may be needed.\n\nHow to approve\n- Reply with an explicit confirmation that includes the data description, e.g.:\n  \"I approve deletion of [exact data description] and confirm I have backups and authority.\"\n- Or reply with: \"CONFIRM DELETE [data description]\" to proceed.\n\nI will wait for your detailed info and explicit approval before taking any action. Do you want to provide the details now and approve deletion?"
