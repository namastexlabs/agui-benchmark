I can, however, help in several ways \u2014 pick what you want:\n\n- I can simulate what the tool would do and produce example output.\n- I can write code that would call the tool (so you can run it where the tool exists).\n- I can implement the requested functionality directly here (in Python or pseudo-code).\n- I can show how to mock the tool for tests.\n\nGive me the task you intended that tool to perform (e.g., fetch a URL, run a shell command, query a database, transform data, call an API), and I\u2019ll do one of the options above. \n\nQuick example \u2014 mocking the tool in Python so you can run tests locally:\n\nfrom unittest.mock import Mock\nnonexistent_tool = Mock(return_value=\"mocked result\")\nprint(nonexistent_tool())  # prints: mocked result\n\nTell me what you wanted the tool to do and which option you prefer."}
