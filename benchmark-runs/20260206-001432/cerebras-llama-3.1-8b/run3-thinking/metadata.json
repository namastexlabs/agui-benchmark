    "final_text": "To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with the given equation: x + 5 = 12\n\nOur goal is to get rid of the +5 on the left side of the equation. \n\n2. To do this, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will keep the equation balanced and allow us to isolate x.\n\n3. So, we subtract 5 from both sides: x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\nSimplifying the left side, we get: x = 7\n\nTherefore, x is equal to 7."
