    "final_text": "To find the value of x in the equation x + 5 = 12, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the given equation: x + 5 = 12\n\n2. The goal is to isolate x, which means we want to get x by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to get rid of the +5 on the same side as x.\n\n3. To get rid of the +5, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will keep the equation balanced.\n\n4. Subtract 5 from both sides: x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n5. Simplify both sides of the equation. The +5 and -5 cancel each other out on the left side, and 12 - 5 = 7 on the right side.\n\n6. The equation now looks like this: x = 7\n\n7. Therefore, the value of x is 7."
