    "final_text": "To find the value of x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. The equation is x + 5 = 12. Our goal is to get x by itself.\n\n2. To remove the +5 from x, we need to subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will keep the equation balanced.\n\n   x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n   This simplifies to:\n   x = 7\n\n3. By performing the subtraction, we have isolated x on one side of the equation and found its value. \n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
