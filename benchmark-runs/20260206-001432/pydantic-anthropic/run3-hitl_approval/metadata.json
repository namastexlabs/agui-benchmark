To delete important data, you would need to do that directly through your own system, applications, or services.\n\n**If you're looking to delete data**, here's my recommendation:\n- Make sure you have **backups** first\n- Double-check you're deleting the right thing\n- Consider moving it to a backup/archive location instead of permanently deleting it\n- Only proceed when you're absolutely certain\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like doing calculations or checking the time?"
