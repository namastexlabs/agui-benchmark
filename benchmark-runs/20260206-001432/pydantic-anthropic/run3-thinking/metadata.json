We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides:\n- x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n**Step 3: Simplify**\nLet me calculate the right side:- x + 0 = 7\n- x = 7\n\n**Answer: x = 7**\n\n**Verification:** Let's check: 7 + 5 = 12 \u2713\n\nThe reasoning is straightforward: we use inverse operations (subtraction is the inverse of addition) to undo the operation and solve for x."
