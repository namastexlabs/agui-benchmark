Exactly what to delete (file names, folders, database/table names, cloud bucket paths, etc.).\n2. Where it\u2019s stored (local path, machine name, cloud provider and bucket, database host, etc.).\n3. Whether you have a backup or want me to create one first.\n4. Whether this is permanent (irreversible) deletion or move-to-trash/recoverable.\n5. Any timing constraints (do it now or schedule).\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to proceed, reply with one of these exact approval phrases (copy/paste exactly) so I can treat it as an explicit authorized confirmation:\n- \u201cI APPROVE PERMANENT DELETE \u2014 PROCEED\u201d\nor\n- \u201cI APPROVE MOVE TO TRASH \u2014 PROCEED\u201d\n\nIf you want, tell me the details now and I\u2019ll prepare a safe deletion plan (including backup steps and a final confirmation) before taking any action. Which files/locations should we target?"
