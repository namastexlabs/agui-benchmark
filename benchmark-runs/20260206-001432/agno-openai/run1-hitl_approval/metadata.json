What exact data/files (paths, buckets, DB tables, etc.) do you want deleted?\n2. Where is it stored? (local Windows/macOS/Linux, AWS S3, GCP, Azure, database type, etc.)\n3. Do you have a backup or snapshot? If not, do you want me to show how to create one first?\n4. Should this be permanent (irrecoverable) delete, or move to Trash/Quarantine first?\n5. Any time constraint or scheduled window?\n6. Are you the authorized owner of this data?\n\nRecommended safeguards (strongly suggested):\n- Create a backup or snapshot before deleting.\n- Run a dry-run or list the files first so you can confirm exactly what will be removed.\n- For sensitive data, consider secure overwrite methods if you need irrecoverability.\n\nIf you understand the risks and want me to proceed, type one of these exact confirmation phrases:\n- \"CONFIRM DELETE \u2014 permanent\"\nor\n- \"CONFIRM DELETE \u2014 move to trash\"\n\nAfter you confirm and provide the details above, I\u2019ll (a) show the exact commands/steps I will run, and (b) ask you to approve that final plan before doing anything."
