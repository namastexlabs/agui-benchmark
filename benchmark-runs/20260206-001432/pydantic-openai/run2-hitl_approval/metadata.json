Where is the data stored? (local PC \u2014 Windows/macOS/Linux, external drive, or cloud service: Google Drive, Dropbox, AWS S3, etc.)\n2. Exactly what should be deleted? (file paths, folder names, bucket/object names, or a description so I can help identify them)\n3. Do you have a backup or want me to include backup steps first?\n4. Do you want a soft delete (move to Trash/Recycle Bin) or permanent/secure erase (overwriting)?\n5. Do you want a dry-run first (list what would be deleted) before actual deletion?\n6. Who will perform the deletion \u2014 you following my commands, or do you want scripts/commands I can produce for you to run? (I can\u2019t directly access your systems.)\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, tell me the answers and confirm how you want me to proceed. I will only provide destructive commands or proceed after you type this explicit confirmation phrase: YES, DELETE. If you prefer a different confirmation phrase, tell me which one."
