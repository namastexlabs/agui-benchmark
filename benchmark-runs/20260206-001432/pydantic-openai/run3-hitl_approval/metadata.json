Before I proceed, I need a few details and your clear, unambiguous confirmation.\n\nPlease answer these questions:\n1. What exact data do you want deleted? (describe files/folders, database/table, cloud bucket, etc.)\n2. Where is it located? (local PC \u2014 Windows/macOS/Linux, external drive, Google Drive, Dropbox, AWS S3, Azure, a database server, etc.)\n3. Do you have a backup? If not, do you want me to remind you how to make one?\n4. Should the deletion be reversible (move to Trash/Recycle Bin or mark deleted) or permanent/secure (overwrite, purge, remove from backups)?\n5. Any legal, compliance, or business retention requirements I should be aware of?\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to proceed, type an explicit confirmation phrase so I know you approve. For example, reply exactly (including the brackets replaced with your data description):\n\nCONFIRM DELETE \u2014 Permanently delete: [brief description of the data and its location]\n\nI will not take any deletion steps until I receive that exact confirmation. If you want, tell me the platform now and I\u2019ll prepare step-by-step deletion instructions and a recommended backup checklist before you confirm."
