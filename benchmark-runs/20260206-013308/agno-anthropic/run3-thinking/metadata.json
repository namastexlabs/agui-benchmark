We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation (whatever we do to one side, we must do to the other to keep it balanced).\n\nx + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n**Step 3: Simplify both sides**\nLet me calculate 12 - 5:**Step 4: Final answer**\nx = 7\n\n**Verification:** Let's check our answer by substituting x = 7 back into the original equation:\n7 + 5 = 12 \u2713\n\nThe answer is **x = 7**."
