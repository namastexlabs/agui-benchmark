I don't have access to your files, databases, accounts, or any systems that would allow me to delete information.\n\nIf you're looking to delete data from your own systems, you would need to:\n- Do it directly through your device, application, or service\n- Contact the appropriate administrator or support team\n- Use the official deletion/removal features provided by whatever platform or application stores that data\n\n**Is there something specific I can help you with instead?** For example, I could help you think through data management, calculate storage sizes, or assist with other questions you might have."
