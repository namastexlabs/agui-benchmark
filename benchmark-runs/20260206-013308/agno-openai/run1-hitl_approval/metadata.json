Where is the data located? (local PC, external drive, cloud provider \u2014 name, or a database \u2014 name and connection details)\n2. Do you want permanent (irrecoverable) secure deletion, or just move to trash/archive so it can be recovered for a time?\n3. Do you already have a backup? If not, do you want help making one first?\n4. Any legal/retention or access constraints I should know about (e.g., compliance, other users who rely on this data)?\n5. Do you want me to:\n   - provide step-by-step commands/instructions for you to run, or\n   - generate a script you\u2019ll review and run, or\n   - (if applicable) prepare commands for an admin who has system access?\n   Note: I cannot directly access or delete files on your systems \u2014 I can only provide instructions or scripts.\n\nIf you want me to proceed after I prepare the plan, reply with this exact confirmation phrase so I know you explicitly approve irreversible action:\n\"I APPROVE PERMANENT DELETION\"\n\nIf you prefer a different confirmation phrase or want a soft deletion first, tell me which. Once you answer the questions above, I\u2019ll prepare a deletion plan and wait for your exact confirmation phrase before giving any irreversible commands."
