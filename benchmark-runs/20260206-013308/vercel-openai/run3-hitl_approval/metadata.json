(file(s), folder(s), database rows, user account(s), cloud storage, backups, etc.)  \n2. Where is the data located? (device name, path, server, S3 bucket, Google Drive, SQL database + table, etc.)  \n3. Do you want permanent (irreversible) deletion or a soft/trash delete you can recover from?  \n4. Do you want me to create a backup/archive first?  \n5. Any constraints or timing (do this now, schedule, or only after additional verification)?  \n6. Confirm you have authority to delete this data (legal/organizational consent).\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, reply with this exact confirmation phrase including a short description of the data to delete:\nCONFIRM DELETE \u2014 [brief description of data and location]\n\nI will only proceed after receiving that exact confirmation."
