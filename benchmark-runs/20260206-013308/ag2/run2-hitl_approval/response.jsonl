(local PC, external drive, server, cloud provider \u2014 name the provider)\n3. Do you have a recent backup or do you want me to create one first?\n4. Do you want a normal delete (recoverable) or a secure wipe (hard to recover)?\n5. Any time window or constraints?\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, reply with:\n- your answers to 1\u20135, and\n- the exact confirmation phrase: CONFIRM DELETE\n\nI will only proceed after I receive that confirmation."}
