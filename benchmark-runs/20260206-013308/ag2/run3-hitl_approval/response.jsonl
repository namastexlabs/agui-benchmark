A few quick questions before I proceed:\n\n1. Exactly which data do you want to delete? (file/folder paths, device, cloud account, database, etc.)\n2. Where is it stored? (local drive, external drive, NAS, Google Drive, Dropbox, AWS S3, database server\u2026)\n3. Do you have a verified backup you can restore from if needed? Deletion may be irreversible.\n4. Do you want a simple delete (trash/recycle) or permanent/secure deletion (overwriting)? Secure deletion is harder/impossible on some storage types (e.g., SSDs, cloud services).\n5. Any legal, compliance, or account-access concerns I should know about?\n\nIf you still want me to proceed after answering the above, please confirm explicitly by typing: I approve deleting the specified data \u2014 and include the exact target(s). I will wait for that confirmation."}
