Feel free to ask me anything, and I'll do my best to help!To find the value of x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.\n\nGiven equation: x + 5 = 12\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides: x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\nThis simplifies to: x = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
