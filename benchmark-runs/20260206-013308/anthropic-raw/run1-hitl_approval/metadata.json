Perform basic math calculations\n\nI don't have access to files, databases, accounts, or any systems that store your data. I can't delete, modify, or access any information on your devices or accounts.\n\nIf you're looking to delete data from somewhere specific (like a cloud service, application, or your device), you would need to:\n- Access that service or application directly\n- Follow their deletion procedures\n- Take responsibility for backing up important information first\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like a calculation or checking the time?"
