I also can't execute deletion commands or modify anything on your devices or accounts.\n\nIf you're looking to delete data somewhere, you would need to:\n- Do it directly through that service or application yourself\n- Contact the support team for that specific service\n- Use the appropriate admin tools or commands for your system\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like a math calculation or checking the time?"
