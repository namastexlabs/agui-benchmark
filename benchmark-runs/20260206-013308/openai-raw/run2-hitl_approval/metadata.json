Exactly what data you want deleted (files, folders, database, account, etc.) and where it\u2019s stored (device, cloud provider, server, path).\n2. Whether you have a current backup or want me to walk you through making one.\n3. Should the data be permanently deleted (irrecoverable) or moved to an archive/recycle bin for a grace period?\n4. Any constraints or consequences I should know about (legal/organizational policies, shared access, linked services).\n5. Do you want me to provide deletion commands/steps, or to proceed if I had the ability to delete?\n\nWhen you\u2019ve answered, I will ask for an explicit approval step. To confirm deletion you will need to reply with one of these exact phrases (pick one when ready):\n- \u201cI approve permanent deletion\u201d\n- \u201cI approve archive deletion\u201d\n- \u201cCancel \u2014 do not delete\u201d\n\nWhich data are we targeting, and do you have a backup?"
