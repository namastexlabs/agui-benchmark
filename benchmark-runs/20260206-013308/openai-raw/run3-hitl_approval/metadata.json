Do you want commands/scripts I can run, or step\u2011by\u2011step manual instructions?\n\nWarning: permanent deletion may be irreversible. If you still want me to prepare deletion instructions or a script, type exactly CONFIRM DELETE and I will proceed to generate the specific steps for the environment you specify."
