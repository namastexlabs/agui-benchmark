Before we proceed I need a few details so I can prepare a safe, reversible plan and show you exactly what will be deleted.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. What exactly to delete (paths, filenames, database name/table, S3 bucket/prefix, VM/disk name, etc.).\n2. Where it lives (local machine, server hostname or IP, cloud provider and region, database engine + connection info).\n3. Desired method (move to trash/recycle bin, permanent delete, secure overwrite/zero-fill, shred, delete backups as well).\n4. Any backups or snapshots that must be preserved, and whether you have verified them.\n5. Time window / downtime constraints and whether other users/processes depend on this data.\n6. Your preferred outcome if something goes wrong (rollback, restore from backup, stop procedure).\n7. Whether you want a dry-run (show commands that would run without executing) and logs of actions.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve given the details above, type the exact confirmation phrase:\nCONFIRM DELETE\n\nI will not take any deletion action until I see that exact phrase after the details. If you prefer, I can also first produce a deletion plan/commands for you to review (no changes) \u2014 tell me which you want."
