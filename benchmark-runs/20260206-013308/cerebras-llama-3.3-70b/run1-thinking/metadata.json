    "final_text": "To solve for x, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Write down the given equation**: x + 5 = 12\n2. **Identify the goal**: I want to isolate x, which means I want to get x by itself on one side of the equation.\n3. **Look for the operation that is being performed on x**: In this case, 5 is being added to x.\n4. **To isolate x, I need to \"undo\" the addition operation**: To do this, I will subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the +5 on the left side.\n\nSo, I will subtract 5 from both sides:\n\nx + 5 = 12\nx + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
