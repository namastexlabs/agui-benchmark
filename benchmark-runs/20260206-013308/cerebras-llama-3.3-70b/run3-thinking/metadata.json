    "final_text": "To solve for x, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Write down the equation: x + 5 = 12\n2. **My goal is to isolate x, which means I want to get x alone on one side of the equation. To do this, I need to get rid of the 5 that is being added to x. I can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation. This will keep the equation balanced.\n\nSo, I will subtract 5 from both sides: x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n1. **Simplifying both sides, I get**: x = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
