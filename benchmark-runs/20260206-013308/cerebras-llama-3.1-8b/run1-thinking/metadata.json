    "final_text": "To find x in the equation x + 5 = 12, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the equation**: We have a simple equation where x is added to 5 and the result is 12.\n\n2. **Identify the goal**: Our goal is to isolate x, meaning we want to find the value of x that makes the equation true.\n\n3. **Start solving**: To isolate x, we need to get rid of the +5 on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.\n\n4. **Apply the operation**: Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: \n   x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n   This simplifies to: x = 7\n\n5. **Verify the solution**: Let's plug our solution back into the original equation to make sure it's true:\n   x + 5 = 12\n   7 + 5 = 12\n   12 = 12\n   This confirms that x = 7 is the correct solution.\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
