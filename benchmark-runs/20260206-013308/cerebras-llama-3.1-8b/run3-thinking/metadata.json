The goal is to get x by itself, so we need to get rid of the +5 on the left side.\n3. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation. This keeps the equation balanced.\n4. Subtract 5 from both sides: x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n5. Simplify the equation: x = 7\n\nNow we have the value of x."
