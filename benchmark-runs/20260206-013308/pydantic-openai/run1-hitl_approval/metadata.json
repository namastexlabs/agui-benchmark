(files, folders, database rows, cloud buckets, emails, etc.) Include paths or identifiers.\n2) Where is it stored? (Windows, macOS, Linux, Google Drive, Dropbox, AWS S3, Google Cloud, Azure, a specific database, etc.)\n3) Do you want permanent (irreversible) deletion or move to trash/archive?  \n4) Do you have a backup or snapshot? Do you want me to create one first (I can give commands/steps)?\n5) Are you authorized to delete this data (you or your organization)? Any legal/retention requirements I should know about?\n\nIf you understand the risks and are authorized, confirm exactly by replying:\n\"I approve deletion of the items described above.\"\n\nAfter I receive that exact confirmation and the details from questions 1\u20135, I will proceed (or give the precise deletion commands/steps if I can't access the system)."
