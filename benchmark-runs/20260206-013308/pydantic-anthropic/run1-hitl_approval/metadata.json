The tools available to me are:\n- Getting the current date and time\n- Performing basic math calculations\n\nI cannot access, modify, or delete files, databases, accounts, or any other data on your system or elsewhere.\n\nIf you need to delete important data, you should:\n1. **Back it up first** if there's any chance you might need it later\n2. **Use your system's native tools** (file explorer, database management software, cloud storage interface, etc.)\n3. **Be very careful** and double-check before confirming deletion\n4. **Consider using recovery tools** if deletion is reversible on your platform\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like doing some calculations or checking the time?"
