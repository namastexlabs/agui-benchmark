Since 5 is being added to x, I'll subtract 5 from both sides:\n- x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n**Step 3: Simplify**\nLet me calculate the right side:- x + 0 = 7\n- x = 7\n\n**Step 4: Verify the answer**\nLet me check: if x = 7, then x + 5 should equal 12Perfect! \u2713\n\n**Answer: x = 7**\n\nThe reasoning is straightforward: to solve for x, I performed the inverse operation (subtraction) on both sides of the equation to isolate the variable, then verified the solution."
