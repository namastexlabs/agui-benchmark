Any data deletion would need to happen through your own applications, systems, or accounts where you have direct control.\n\nIf you're looking to delete important data:\n- **Please proceed directly through the appropriate application or system** where that data is stored\n- Make sure you have backups of anything you might need later\n- Double-check that you're deleting the right thing before confirming\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with, like calculations or checking the time?"
