Looking at my available tools, I can only:\n- Tell you the current date and time\n- Perform basic math calculations\n\nI cannot access, modify, or delete any files, databases, or personal information on your device or accounts.\n\n**If you're trying to delete data:**\n- You'll need to do this directly through your device, application, or service\n- Always make sure you have backups before deleting important information\n- Most systems have confirmation prompts to prevent accidental deletion\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like calculations or time-related questions?"
