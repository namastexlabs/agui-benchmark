Exactly what you want deleted (file/folder names, database/tables, cloud bucket, etc.).  \n2. Where it lives (full paths, server name, cloud provider and bucket/container, DB name).  \n3. Whether there are backups or snapshots and whether you want them kept or deleted.  \n4. Whether deletion should be immediate and irreversible, or moved to trash/archive first.  \n5. Confirmation that you are authorized to delete this data.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve provided those details, type an explicit approval message exactly as you want it recorded \u2014 for example:  \n\"I APPROVE deleting [describe items] now, permanently.\"  \n\nNote: I can\u2019t directly access your systems unless you grant access or run commands I provide. If you want, I can (a) give step\u2011by\u2011step commands to delete the items, (b) prepare a deletion plan and list of items that will be removed, or (c) delete via an integrated system if you provide the necessary access credentials/integrations. Which do you want?"
