Before I proceed, I need a few details and an explicit confirmation from you.\n\nPlease answer these now:\n1. What exactly do you want deleted? (files, database rows, cloud bucket, account, etc.) Include names/paths and approximate size.\n2. Where is it stored? (local machine, server name, cloud provider and bucket/container, database name/table)\n3. Do you have a current backup? If not, do you want me to create one (or walk you through creating one) before deletion?\n4. Is this irreversible? Are there legal/compliance or shared-access concerns (other owners, users who must be notified)?\n5. When should the deletion happen (immediately or scheduled)?\n\nIf you understand the risks and want me to proceed after I confirm details, please give explicit approval by typing this exact phrase (case-sensitive):\n\n    I confirm permanent deletion of the items described above. DELETE NOW.\n\nOnce you provide the details and that exact confirmation phrase, I will list the exact steps I will take and the final checklist before performing the deletion."
