If you need to delete important data, you would need to:\n\n- Use your operating system's file manager or command line tools directly\n- Use the application that manages that data\n- Contact your IT department or system administrator if it's shared/organizational data\n\n**Before deleting important data**, I'd recommend:\n\u2713 Creating backups first\n\u2713 Double-checking you're deleting the right files\n\u2713 Confirming with relevant stakeholders if it's shared data\n\u2713 Reviewing any retention policies that might apply\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like doing a calculation or checking the time?"
