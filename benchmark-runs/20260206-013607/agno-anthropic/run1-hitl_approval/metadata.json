I can only:\n\n- Tell you the current time\n- Perform basic math calculations\n\nI don't have access to your files, databases, or any storage systems. I can't execute delete commands or modify your data in any way.\n\nIf you're looking to delete important data on your own system, I'd recommend:\n1. **Back up your data first** if you haven't already\n2. **Double-check what you're deleting** to make sure it's really what you want to remove\n3. **Verify the deletion method** is appropriate for your system (recycle bin, secure deletion tools, etc.)\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like doing calculations or checking the time?"
