However, I should clarify that I don't actually have the ability to delete any data on your system. \n\nI'm an AI assistant running on the Agno framework with access to only two tools:\n- **Getting the current time**\n- **Doing basic math calculations**\n\nI cannot:\n- Access your files or databases\n- Delete, modify, or retrieve any data\n- Connect to your systems or accounts\n- Perform any file operations\n\nIf you need to delete important data on your computer or in an application, you would need to:\n1. Use that application directly or contact its support\n2. Consult your IT department if it's a work system\n3. Make sure you have proper backups before deleting anything critical\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like calculations or checking the time? Or did you have questions about data management best practices?"
