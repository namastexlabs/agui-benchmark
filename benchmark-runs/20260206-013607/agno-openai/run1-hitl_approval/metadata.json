What exactly do you want deleted? (files, folders, database rows, cloud objects, entire disk, etc.)  \n2. Where is it stored? (local PC, external drive, Google Drive, AWS S3, Azure, a specific server, database name, etc.)  \n3. Is there a backup? Do you want me to create one or guide you to create one first?  \n4. Is deletion permanent (irreversible) or do you want to move to trash/archival first?  \n5. Any time constraints or user/account permissions I should be aware of?\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to proceed, explicitly approve by replying with this exact phrase including the description of what to delete:\n\nI APPROVE deleting: [brief description of the data and location]\n\nExample:\nI APPROVE deleting: folder \"OldInvoices\" on Google Drive account user@example.com, permanent delete.\n\nI will wait for that exact approval phrase before giving deletion instructions or taking any further steps."
