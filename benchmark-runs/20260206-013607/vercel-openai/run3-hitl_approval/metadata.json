Your preferred method (GUI steps, terminal/CLI commands, cloud console, API).\n\nIf you understand the risks and want me to proceed after we finalize the details, reply with one of these exact confirmation phrases (pick one and paste it as your reply):\n- CONFIRM DELETE \u2014 proceed with deletion now\n- CONFIRM BACKUP AND DELETE \u2014 create a backup first, then delete\n- CANCEL \u2014 do not delete\n\nI will wait for those details and your exact confirmation phrase before taking any deletion steps or giving precise commands."
