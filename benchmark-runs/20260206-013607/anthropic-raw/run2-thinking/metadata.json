    "final_text": "I need to solve the equation **x + 5 = 12** for x.\n\nHere's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Start with the equation:** x + 5 = 12\n\n2. **Isolate x:** To get x by itself, I need to remove the +5 from the left side. I do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.\n\n3. **Apply the operation:** \n   - Left side: x + 5 - 5 = x\n   - Right side: 12 - 5 = 7\n\n4. **Result:** x = 7\n\nLet me verify this with a calculation:**Answer: x = 7** \u2713\n\nThe reasoning is based on the principle that whatever operation you perform on one side of an equation, you must perform on the other side to keep it balanced."
