I can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides:\n- x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n**Step 3: Simplify**\n- x = 7\n\n**Step 4: Verify the answer**\nLet me check: If x = 7, then 7 + 5 = 12 \u2713\n\nLet me also calculate this to confirm:**Answer: x = 7**\n\nThe reasoning is based on the principle of inverse operations: since 5 is being added to x, we subtract 5 from both sides to undo that operation and solve for x."
