I can only have conversations and perform simple calculations.\n\nIf you need to delete important data, you would need to:\n- Do it directly yourself using your operating system or application\n- Contact your IT department or system administrator\n- Use the appropriate tools or software designed for data management\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like a math problem or checking the current time?"
