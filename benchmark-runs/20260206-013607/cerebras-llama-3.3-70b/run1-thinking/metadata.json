    "final_text": "To find the value of x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Here's my step-by-step reasoning process:\n\nGiven equation: x + 5 = 12\n\nMy goal is to get x by itself on the left side of the equation. To do this, I need to \"get rid\" of the +5 that's added to x.\n\nTo cancel out the +5, I can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will keep the equation balanced and allow me to isolate x.\n\nSo, I'll subtract 5 from both sides:\n\nx + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
