What exactly should be deleted? (file paths, bucket names, database/table/row identifiers, or a clear description)\n2. Where is the data stored? (local machine, server name/IP, cloud provider and bucket/instance, database type and host, etc.)\n3. Is there a backup or snapshot available? Do you want me to create one or show how to create one first?\n4. Do any services or users depend on this data? Any legal/retention requirements?\n5. When do you want the deletion to happen (immediately or scheduled)?\n6. Do you want a dry-run first (a list of items that would be deleted)?\n7. Will I be given access/credentials to perform the deletion, or do you want step-by-step commands you run yourself?\n\nSafety and authorization:\n- Confirm you are authorized to delete this data.\n- Deletion may be irreversible. I strongly recommend a backup unless you\u2019re sure.\n\nExplicit approval required:\nIf you still want me to proceed after answering the questions above, please type the exact confirmation phrase:\n   CONFIRM DELETE: [brief description of what to delete]\nFor example:\n   CONFIRM DELETE: all files in /var/www/html and bucket my-company-backups/old/\n\nI will not run any deletion until I see that exact confirmation phrase and have the details requested. What would you like to delete?"
