(files/folder names, database, cloud account, etc.)  \n2. Where is it stored? (Windows/Mac/Linux, external drive, Dropbox/Google Drive/AWS, etc.)  \n3. Do you have a backup, or do you want me to include backup steps?  \n4. Should the data be permanently erased (irreversible) or moved to Trash/Recycle Bin first?\n\nIf you want me to proceed after that, confirm by replying with the exact phrase:\nI APPROVE DELETION of [brief description and location]\n\u2014for example: I APPROVE DELETION of \"project_x\" on my MacBook.\n\nNote: I cannot delete files directly from your device or accounts. Once you confirm, I will provide precise, platform-appropriate instructions or commands to carry out the deletion and warn about irreversible actions."
