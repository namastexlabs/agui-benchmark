We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation (whatever we do to one side, we must do to the other to keep the equation balanced).\n\nx + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n**Step 3: Simplify**\nx = 7\n\n**Step 4: Verify the answer**\nLet me check: 7 + 5 = 12 \u2713\n\n**Answer: x = 7**\n\nThe reasoning is based on the principle of maintaining equation balance\u2014by subtracting 5 from both sides, we isolate x and find that it equals 7."
