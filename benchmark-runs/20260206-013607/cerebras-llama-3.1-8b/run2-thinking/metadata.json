    "final_text": "To solve the equation x + 5 = 12, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the equation**: The equation x + 5 = 12 means we have a variable 'x' added to 5, and the result is 12.\n\n2. **Isolate the variable**: To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll subtract 5 from both sides of the equation.\n\n3. **Perform the subtraction**: \n   - On the left side, we have x + 5. Subtracting 5 from this will leave us with just x.\n   - On the right side, we have 12. Subtracting 5 from this will give us 12 - 5 = 7.\n\n4. **Simplify the equation**: After subtracting 5 from both sides, the equation becomes:\n   x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n   This simplifies to:\n   x = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
