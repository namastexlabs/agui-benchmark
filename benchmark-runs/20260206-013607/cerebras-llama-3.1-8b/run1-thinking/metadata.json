    "final_text": "To find the value of x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. \n\nStep 1: We have the equation x + 5 = 12. \n\nStep 2: To isolate x, we need to get rid of the +5 on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation. \n\nStep 3: When we subtract 5 from x + 5, we get x. So the equation becomes x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5.\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the equation, we have x = 12 - 5.\n\nStep 5: Performing the subtraction, we get x = 7.\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
