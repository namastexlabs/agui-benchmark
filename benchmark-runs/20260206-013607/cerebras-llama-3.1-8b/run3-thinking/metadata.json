    "final_text": "To find the value of x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. \n\nStep 1: Our equation is x + 5 = 12. We need to get rid of the +5 on the left side of the equation.\n\nStep 2: To do this, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. When we subtract 5 from the left side, it cancels out the +5. When we subtract 5 from the right side, we are essentially moving the 5 to the left side.\n\nStep 3: The equation now becomes x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5. Simplifying the left side, we get x = 7. Simplifying the right side, we get 7.\n\nStep 4: Now that we have simplified both sides of the equation, we have a new equation: x = 7. This means that the value of x is 7.\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
