I can't access your computer, cloud storage, email, or any other data storage.\n\nIf you're looking to delete data from your own systems, you would need to:\n- Do it directly through the appropriate application or platform\n- Contact the administrator or support team for that service\n- Be very careful and make backups before deleting anything important\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like calculating something or checking the time?"
