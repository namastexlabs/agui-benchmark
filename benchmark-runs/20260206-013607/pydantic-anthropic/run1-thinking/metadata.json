Currently, x has 5 added to it\n3. To undo this addition, we subtract 5 from both sides\n4. This keeps the equation balanced\n\n**Solving:****Answer:** x = 7\n\n**Verification:** Let me check this is correct:\u2713 **Confirmed!** When we substitute x = 7 back into the original equation, we get 7 + 5 = 12, which is true."
