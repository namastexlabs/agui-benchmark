What exactly do you want to delete (files, emails, accounts, databases)?  \n2. Where is it stored (local PC, external drive, Google Drive, Dropbox, AWS, etc.)?  \n3. Do you have a backup or want me to include backup steps first?  \n4. Do you want the data permanently erased (irreversible) or just moved to trash/recoverable?\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to proceed, type one of these exact confirmations so I know you approve:\n- \"DELETE \u2014 permanent, I understand this is irreversible\"\nor\n- \"DELETE \u2014 recoverable, move to trash\"\n\nI will wait for your answers and that exact confirmation before providing any deletion instructions."
