To approve, reply with BOTH:\n  1) The exact list/description of items to delete (copy/paste from your message), and\n  2) This confirmation phrase exactly: I APPROVE PERMANENT DELETE\n\nIf you prefer a soft delete or a dry-run first, say so instead of the phrase above (e.g., \u201cPlease do a dry-run first\u201d).\n\nTell me the details above and how you want to proceed."
