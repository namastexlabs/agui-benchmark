Whether you have a backup and whether you want permanent deletion (irreversible) or move to trash/recycle bin.  \n4. Any account or device access details needed (I won't ask for passwords here; if you need commands I will tell you how to run them).\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to proceed, confirm by replying with the exact phrase:\nCONFIRM DELETE \u2014 [short label for the data]\n(Replace [short label for the data] with a few words identifying what to delete.)\n\nI will only proceed after receiving that exact confirmation. Would you like to provide the details now?"
