What exactly should be deleted? (file names / folders / databases / cloud buckets \u2014 be specific.)\n2. Where is it stored? (local machine, specific server, cloud provider and bucket/instance name, external drive, etc.)\n3. Do you have a backup or do you want me to create/describe a backup procedure first?\n4. Do you want a reversible delete (trash/soft delete) or permanent secure wipe (overwriting/unrecoverable)?\n5. How will the deletion be performed? (Do you want commands I can provide for you to run, or instructions for an admin/engineer to execute? I cannot access your systems directly.)\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, confirm by typing one of these exact approval phrases (so I don\u2019t act on an accidental reply):\n- For reversible delete: I APPROVE REVERSIBLE DELETE for [describe items]\n- For permanent delete: I APPROVE PERMANENT DELETE for [describe items]\n\nI will wait for those details and the exact approval phrase before giving deletion steps or proceeding further."
