(files, database rows, cloud buckets, account, etc.)  \n2. Where is it stored? (local computer + OS, external drive, Google Drive, Dropbox, AWS S3, a database\u2014name and provider)  \n3. Do you have a backup or do you want me to show how to make one?  \n4. Do you want a full permanent deletion (irreversible) or a reversible/soft delete (trash/recoverable)?\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to proceed, confirm with this exact phrase (copy/paste):  \nI confirm delete: [brief description of what to delete]\n\nExample: I confirm delete: my ~/Documents/old_project folder on my Mac (permanent)\n\nI will not take any deletion steps until I receive that exact confirmation phrase. Would you like to provide the details above now?"
