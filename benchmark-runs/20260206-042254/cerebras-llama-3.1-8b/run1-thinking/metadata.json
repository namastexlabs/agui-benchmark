    "final_text": "To solve for x in the equation x + 5 = 12, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with the given equation: \n   x + 5 = 12\n\n2. We need to get x by itself, so we'll get rid of the +5 on the left side. We can do this by performing the opposite operation of addition, which is subtraction. \n   To do this, we'll subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to keep the equation balanced. \n\n3. Subtract 5 from both sides:\n   x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n4. Simplify both sides:\n   x = 7\n\nSo, x is equal to 7."
