    "final_text": "To solve for x in the equation x + 5 = 12, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the goal**: We need to isolate x, which means getting x on one side of the equation by itself.\n\n2. **Look for a constant on the same side as x**: In this equation, we have +5 on the same side as x. Since we want to get x by itself, we need to get rid of the +5.\n\n3. **Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation**: To get rid of the +5, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the +5 on the left side (leaving x on its own) and subtract 5 from 12 on the right side.\n\n   x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n   Simplify the equation by combining like terms on both sides:\n   x = 7\n\n   Therefore, the value of x is 7."
