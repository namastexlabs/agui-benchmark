    "final_text": "To find the value of x in the equation x + 5 = 12, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Write down the equation**: x + 5 = 12\n\n2. **Identify the variable and the constant**: In this equation, x is the variable (the value we want to find), and 5 is the constant (a value that doesn't change).\n\n3. **Subtract the constant from both sides**: To isolate x, we need to get rid of the constant (+5) that is being added to x. To do this, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the +5 on the left side of the equation.\n\n   x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n   x = 7\n\n4. **Simplify the equation**: After subtracting 5 from both sides, we are left with x = 7. This is our final answer.\n\nTherefore, the value of x in the equation x + 5 = 12 is 7."
