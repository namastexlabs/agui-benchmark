What exactly are you deleting (files, database rows, cloud buckets, user accounts, etc.)?\n2. Where is the data stored (Windows, macOS, Linux, AWS/GCP/Azure, Dropbox, MySQL/Postgres, etc.)?\n3. Do you want the data moved to Trash/Recycle Bin (recoverable) or permanently and irreversibly wiped?\n4. Do you have a current backup you can restore from if needed?\n5. Any constraints (must keep metadata, need secure erase, offline device, time window)?\n\nBefore I provide steps, confirm you understand the risk: permanent deletion can be irreversible. If you want me to proceed, reply with explicit approval, for example: \"I approve \u2014 proceed with permanent deletion\" (and include answers to the questions above). I will only continue after that confirmation."
