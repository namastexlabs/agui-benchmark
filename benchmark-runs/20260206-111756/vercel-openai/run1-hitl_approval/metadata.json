Before I can proceed, please provide the following and then give a clear confirmation phrase when you\u2019re ready:\n\n1. What exactly should be deleted?\n   - Precise paths, filenames, bucket names, DB names/tables/queries, or record selection criteria.\n2. Where is the data stored?\n   - Local machine (OS), remote server (SSH), cloud provider & bucket, database type (MySQL/Postgres/Mongo/etc.), SaaS app, etc.\n3. Do you have a verified backup?\n   - If yes, where is it and how can it be restored? If no, do you want instructions to make one first?\n4. Retention / legal constraints\n   - Any compliance or business rules that prevent deletion or require logs/audit?\n5. Do you want a dry-run first?\n   - I can show the exact commands or queries and the items that would be affected without performing deletion.\n6. Desired timing and any other constraints\n   - Immediate, scheduled, maintenance window, or notify other users?\n\nWhen you\u2019ve answered the above, type one of these exact confirmation phrases to authorize the deletion:\n- CONFIRM DELETE \u2014 proceed with deletion now\n- CONFIRM DRY RUN \u2014 only show what would be deleted, don\u2019t delete\n\nIf you prefer a different confirmation phrase, tell me what it is. After you confirm and I have the details, I\u2019ll list the exact steps/commands I propose to run and ask you one more time to confirm before anything is executed."
