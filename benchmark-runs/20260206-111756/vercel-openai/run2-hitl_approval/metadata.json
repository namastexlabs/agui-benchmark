Before we proceed, please answer these quick questions so I know exactly what to do and can show you the precise steps/commands for you to approve:\n\n1. What exactly should be deleted? (files, folders, database rows, S3 bucket, VM, account, etc.)  \n2. Exact location/path and service (e.g., /home/user/docs/report.pdf, AWS S3 bucket my-bucket, Postgres DB mydb.table).  \n3. Do you have a backup or do you want me to make one first?  \n4. Do you want a normal delete (recoverable in some systems) or a secure irreversible wipe/overwrite?  \n5. When should the deletion occur? (now or scheduled)  \n6. Who else will be affected? Do you have authorization to delete this data?  \n7. Any retention or compliance requirements I should know about?\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, type this exact confirmation phrase including a short description of the data to delete (I will do nothing until I receive it):\n\nI CONFIRM DELETE: [short description of the data and location] \u2014 PROCEED\n\nExample:\nI CONFIRM DELETE: /home/alex/old_financials.zip on server-01 \u2014 PROCEED\n\nAfter I receive that exact confirmation, I will show the exact commands/steps I will run and ask you to approve them before executing anything."
