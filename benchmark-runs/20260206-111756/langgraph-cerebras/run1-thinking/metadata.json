To do this, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. \n\nSo, x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5. \n\nThis simplifies to x = 7. \n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7.To find the value of x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. \n\nWe are given the equation: x + 5 = 12\n\nOur goal is to get x by itself. Since 5 is being added to x, we can do the opposite operation, which is subtracting 5, to both sides of the equation.\n\nSo, we subtract 5 from both sides: \nx + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\nThis simplifies to: \nx = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
