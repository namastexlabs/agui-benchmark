The goal is to isolate x, which means we need to get rid of the +5 on the left side of the equation.\n3. To do this, I can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will keep the equation balanced.\n4. So, I will subtract 5 from the left side: x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n5. Simplifying the left side, I get x = 12 - 5\n6. Subtracting 5 from 12, I get x = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
