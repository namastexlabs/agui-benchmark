The equation given is x + 5 = 12. \n\nStep 1: Identify the operation that needs to be undone to isolate x. In this case, we need to subtract 5 from both sides of the equation.\n\nStep 2: Write down the equation with the operation to be undone. \nx + 5 = 12 \n\nStep 3: Apply the operation to both sides of the equation. Since we need to subtract 5, we'll subtract 5 from both sides.\nx + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5 \n\nStep 4: Simplify both sides of the equation.\nx = 7 \n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
