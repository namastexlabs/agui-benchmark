    "final_text": "I need to solve for x in the equation x + 5 = 12.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Start with the equation:** x + 5 = 12\n\n2. **Identify what we need to do:** We need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Currently, x has 5 added to it.\n\n3. **Apply the inverse operation:** To undo addition of 5, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This maintains equality:\n   - x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n4. **Simplify both sides:**\n   - x = 7\n\n5. **Verify the answer:** Let's check by substituting x = 7 back into the original equation:\n   - 7 + 5 = 12 \u2713\n\n**Answer: x = 7**\n\nThe reasoning process uses the fundamental principle of algebra: whatever operation you do to one side of an equation, you must do to the other side to keep the equation balanced. By subtracting 5 from both sides, we isolated x and found its value."
