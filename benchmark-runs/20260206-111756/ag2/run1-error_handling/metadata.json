Which would you prefer?\n\n- I can simulate what that tool would do and show sample input/output.\n- I can write a script/CLI commands you can run locally that replicate the tool\u2019s behavior.\n- I can perform the task directly here if it\u2019s something I can do (text processing, calculations, code, etc.).\n\nTell me what \u201cdo something\u201d means (give a concrete task or example) and which option you want. If useful, here\u2019s a quick example: if the tool was meant to convert CSV to JSON, I can give a ready-to-run Python script or convert a small CSV you paste here."
