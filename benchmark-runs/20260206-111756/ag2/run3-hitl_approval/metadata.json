Before we proceed, I need a bit of information and your explicit confirmation.\n\n1) What exactly do you want deleted?\n   - Type (files, folders, database rows, cloud objects, emails, etc.)\n   - Location/platform (local Windows/macOS/Linux, external drive, AWS S3, Google Drive, Dropbox, MySQL/Postgres, etc.)\n   - Specific paths, names, patterns, or SQL WHERE clause (be as precise as possible)\n\n2) Scope and permanence\n   - Permanent erase (irreversible) or move to Trash/Recycle Bin first?\n   - Date range or other filters (e.g., files older than X days, size > Y, matching pattern *.log)\n\n3) Backup and recovery\n   - Have you backed up the data or do you want me to create an export/backup before deletion? (I strongly recommend a backup.)\n\n4) Any constraints or safety checks you want (e.g., dry run listing items to be deleted first, confirmation after dry run)\n\nI cannot directly access or delete your files from here. I can:\n   - Give exact commands or scripts to run on your system or cloud console\n   - Walk you through the GUI steps\n   - Produce a dry-run listing command you can inspect before final deletion\n\nPlease provide the details above and then explicitly confirm you want me to proceed (for example: \u201cYes \u2014 proceed and permanently delete /path/to/data\u201d or \u201cYes \u2014 show dry run first\u201d). I will wait for your approval before giving or executing any deletion steps."
