Before we continue, please answer these quick questions so I can act safely and correctly:\n\n1. What exactly do you want to delete? (filenames, folders, database, cloud storage, email account, etc.)\n2. Where is it located? (local PC (Windows/macOS/Linux), server, AWS/Azure/GCP, Dropbox/Google Drive, a specific app)\n3. Do you have a backup or do you want me to create one first?\n4. Should the deletion be permanent (irreversible) or moved to trash/recycle bin/archive first?\n5. Are there legal or business constraints I should be aware of (retention policies, shared ownership)?\n6. Do you want me to: \n   - give step-by-step instructions you will run, \n   - generate a deletion script/command, or \n   - (if I have system access) execute the deletion?\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, type the exact confirmation phrase below (copy/paste), and I will proceed with the requested action or provide the deletion steps:\n\nCONFIRM DELETE \u2014 I understand this is permanent and I approve you to proceed.\n\nIf you prefer a less risky option first, type:\nCONFIRM MOVE TO TRASH \u2014 I approve moving the data to trash/recycle (recoverable).\n\nTell me the answers to the questions above and paste one of the confirmation phrases when you want me to proceed.", "_timestamp": 25322.159140044, "_offset_ms": 2.0, "_index": 2}
