I can't delete, modify, or access any of your information.\n\nIf you're looking to delete data on your own system, you'll need to:\n1. Use your operating system's file manager or system tools\n2. Contact your IT administrator or relevant service provider\n3. Follow your organization's data management procedures\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like math calculations or checking the time?"
