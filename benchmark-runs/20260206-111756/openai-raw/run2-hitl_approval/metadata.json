What exactly is the data (files, database rows, S3 bucket, account, etc.) and where is it located (local machine, server, cloud provider, DB type and name, path or object keys)?\n2. Do you have a complete backup or export? (Yes / No)\n3. Do you want a reversible (soft/archive) delete or a permanent irrecoverable delete (overwrite/DB purge)?\n4. Do you want me to: a) provide step-by-step instructions, b) generate commands/scripts, or c) just confirm once you\u2019re ready to proceed?\n5. Any deadline or downtime constraints?\n\nTo proceed with a permanent deletion I require an explicit approval phrase. Type exactly one of these (choose one):\n- I APPROVE PERMANENT DELETE\nor\n- I APPROVE SOFT DELETE\n\nAlso reply with \u201cBackup: Yes\u201d or \u201cBackup: No\u201d so I know whether you have a backup.\n\nI\u2019ll wait for your answers and the exact approval phrase before doing or giving any destructive commands."
