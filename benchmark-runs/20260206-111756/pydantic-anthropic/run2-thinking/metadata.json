Since 5 is being added to x, I'll subtract 5 from both sides:\n- x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n**Step 3: Simplify**\n- x = 7\n\n**Step 4: Verify the answer**\nLet me check by substituting x = 7 back into the original equation:\n- 7 + 5 = 12 \u2713\n\n**Answer: x = 7**\n\nThe reasoning is straightforward: to undo addition, we use subtraction. By subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation, we maintain the equality while isolating x on the left side."
