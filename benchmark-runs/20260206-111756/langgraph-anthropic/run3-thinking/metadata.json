I'll do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation (this maintains the equality):\n- x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n**Step 3: Simplify both sides**\n- x + 0 = 7\n- x = 7\n\n**Step 4: Verify the answer**\nLet me check by substituting x = 7 back into the original equation:\n- 7 + 5 = 12 \u2713\n\n**Answer: x = 7**\n\nThe reasoning follows the principle that whatever operation you perform on one side of an equation, you must perform on the other side to keep it balanced. By subtracting 5 from both sides, we isolated x and found its value.I'll solve this step-by-step using logical reasoning.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the equation**\nWe have: x + 5 = 12\n\n**Step 2: Isolate the variable x**\nTo find x, I need to remove the \"+5\" from the left side.
