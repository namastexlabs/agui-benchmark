    "final_text": "To solve for x in the equation x + 5 = 12, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Write down the equation**: x + 5 = 12\n2. **Identify the goal**: We need to isolate x, which means we want to get x by itself on one side of the equation.\n3. **Notice the constant term**: The constant term is 5, which is being added to x. To isolate x, we need to get rid of the 5.\n4. **Subtract 5 from both sides**: To get rid of the 5 on the left side, we'll subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the 5 on the left side.\n\nx + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n5. **Simplify both sides**: Subtracting 5 from both sides will leave us with:\n\nx = 7\n\n6. **Check the solution**: Let's plug x = 7 back into the original equation to make sure it's true:\n\n7 + 5 = 12\n\nThis is indeed true, so our solution is correct."
