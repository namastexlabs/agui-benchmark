I can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides:\n- x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n- x = 12 - 5\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the result****Answer: x = 7**\n\n**Verification:** Let's check our answer by substituting x = 7 back into the original equation:\n- 7 + 5 = 12 \u2713\n\nThe reasoning is simple: to solve for x when it's being added to a number, we subtract that number from both sides of the equation. This maintains the equality while isolating the variable.**Answer: x = 7**\n\n**Verification:** Let's check our answer by substituting x = 7 back into the original equation:\n- 7 + 5 = 12 \u2713\n\nThe reasoning is simple: to solve for x when it's being added to a number, we subtract that number from both sides of the equation.
