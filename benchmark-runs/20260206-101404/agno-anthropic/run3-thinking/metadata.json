I do this by subtracting 5 from both sides (whatever you do to one side, you must do to the other to maintain equality)\n\n4. **Apply the operation:**\n   - x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n   - x = 7\n\n5. **Verification:** Let me check if x = 7 is correct by substituting it back into the original equation:\n   - 7 + 5 = 12 \u2713\n\n**Answer: x = 7**\n\nThe reasoning process follows the fundamental principle of algebra: to solve for an unknown, perform the same operation on both sides of the equation to isolate the variable."
