(Yes/No \u2014 if no, do you want instructions to back up first?)  \n4) Is this deletion reversible (trash/recycle) or permanent/secure wipe?  \n5) Any compliance/legal/other users affected?  \n6) Do you want me to (a) give step-by-step instructions you will run, or (b) run the deletion for you (if I have the ability/integration)? \u2014 tell me which.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to proceed, type one of these exact confirmation phrases (pick one and replace the bracketed text where shown):\n\n- I approve: DELETE [brief description of what will be deleted]  \n- CONFIRM PERMANENT DELETE: [brief description]\n\nExample: I approve: DELETE folder /home/alice/old_backups\n\nI will wait for your answers and that exact approval phrase before taking or describing any destructive action."
