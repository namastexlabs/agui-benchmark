The given equation is x + 5 = 12. \n\nFirst, we want to get x by itself, so we need to remove the 5 from the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation. This keeps the equation balanced.\n\nSo, x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5, which simplifies to x = 7.\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7.To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. The given equation is x + 5 = 12. \n\nFirst, we want to get rid of the +5 on the same side as x. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation. This keeps the equation balanced.\n\nSo, x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\nThis simplifies to x = 7.\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
