Write down the equation: x + 5 = 12\n2. **My goal is to isolate x, which means I need to get x by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, I need to get rid of the 5 that is being added to x. I can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation. This will keep the equation balanced.\n\nSo, I will subtract 5 from both sides:\nx + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n1. **Simplify both sides of the equation. The 5's cancel each other out on the left side, and 12 - 5 = 7 on the right side.\n\nx = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
