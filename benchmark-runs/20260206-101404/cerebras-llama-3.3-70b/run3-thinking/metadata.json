    "final_text": "To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Here's my step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. The given equation is: x + 5 = 12\n2. **My goal is to get x by itself, so I need to remove the \"+ 5\" from the left side of the equation. To do this, I can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will keep the equation balanced and allow me to isolate x. So, I'll subtract 5 from both sides**: x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n3. **Simplifying both sides of the equation, I get**: x = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
