    "final_text": "To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The equation is x + 5 = 12.\n2. My goal is to get x by itself, so I want to get rid of the +5 on the left side of the equation.\n3. To do this, I can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will keep the equation balanced.\n4. So, I'll subtract 5 from both sides: x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5.\n5. The +5 and -5 on the left side cancel each other out, leaving me with just x.\n6. On the right side, 12 - 5 = 7.\n7. Therefore, the equation becomes x = 7.\n\nSo, the value of x is 7."
