Do it directly through the appropriate application or system\n2. Contact your IT administrator or the service provider\n3. Use the proper backup and recovery procedures for your data\n\n**Important reminder:** Before deleting any important data, please make sure you have:\n- \u2705 Backed it up securely\n- \u2705 Verified you're deleting the correct files/data\n- \u2705 Checked if there are any dependencies or other systems relying on that data\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with, like calculations or checking the time?"
