I recommend backing up before deleting.\n\nIf you still want me to proceed, please confirm by replying with this exact phrase (so I know you approve): \n\"I approve permanent deletion of [brief description of the data].\"\n\nReplace [brief description of the data] with what you want deleted. I will only act after receiving that exact confirmation and after we agree on the details above."
