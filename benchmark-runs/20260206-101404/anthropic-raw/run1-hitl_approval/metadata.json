Do it directly through the appropriate application or system\n2. Contact your IT administrator or support team if you need assistance\n3. Use the proper data management tools for your specific platform\n\nIf you have concerns about an important deletion you need to make, I'd recommend:\n- Making a backup first\n- Double-checking which data you want to delete\n- Following your organization's data retention and deletion policies\n\nIs there something specific I can help you with instead?"
