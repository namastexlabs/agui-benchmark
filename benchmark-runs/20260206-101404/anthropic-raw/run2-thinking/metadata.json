We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation (this keeps the equation balanced):\n- x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n**Step 3: Simplify**\n- x + 0 = 7\n- x = 7\n\n**Step 4: Verify the answer**\nLet's check by substituting x = 7 back into the original equation:\n- 7 + 5 = 12 \u2713\n\n**Answer: x = 7**\n\nThe reasoning is straightforward: since 5 is added to x to get 12, we subtract 5 from 12 to find x."
