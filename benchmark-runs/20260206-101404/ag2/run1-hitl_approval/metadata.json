(files, folders, database rows, cloud storage, account, etc.)  \n2. Where is it stored? (local machine \u2014 OS, cloud provider/service, server, database type)  \n3. Scope: permanent erase vs move to trash/recycle bin vs archive.  \n4. Do you want a backup/export first? (recommended if recovery may be needed)  \n5. Are there time constraints or a scheduled time to perform this?  \n6. Any dependencies or related systems that could be affected?\n\nI can\u2019t directly access your devices unless you give me access or run commands I provide. If you want me to proceed after you supply the details, please give explicit approval by replying exactly with:\n\n\"I approve deletion of [brief description of the data].\"\n\n(Replace the bracketed text with the data description.) I will only proceed after receiving that exact confirmation."
