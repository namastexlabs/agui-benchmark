Please provide:\n- What exactly to delete (file names/paths, database/table names, cloud bucket and object keys, or system identifiers).\n- Where it is (machine/hostname, cloud provider & region, account or project).\n- Whether you want a soft delete (recoverable) or permanent deletion (irreversible).\n- Whether a backup exists (and where) or whether you want me to make one first.\n- Any timing constraints (do it now or at a scheduled time).\n- Any legal/compliance or multi-user approvals required.\n\nIf you confirm, type an explicit approval phrase so I can proceed safely. For example:\n- \u201cI approve deletion of the data described above\u201d (to proceed), or\n- \u201cDo not delete\u201d (to cancel).\n\nI will wait for your details and that explicit approval phrase before taking any action."
