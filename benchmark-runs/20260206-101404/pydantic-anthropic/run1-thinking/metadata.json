We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:\n- x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n**Step 3: Simplify both sides**\n- x + 0 = 7\n- x = 7\n\n**Step 4: Verify the answer**\nLet me check by substituting x = 7 back into the original equation:Perfect! \u2713\n\n**Answer: x = 7**\n\n**Reasoning:** We solved this by using the fundamental principle of algebra\u2014whatever operation we perform on one side of the equation, we must perform on the other side to maintain balance. By subtracting 5 from both sides, we isolated x and found that x = 7. The verification confirms this is correct since 7 + 5 = 12."
