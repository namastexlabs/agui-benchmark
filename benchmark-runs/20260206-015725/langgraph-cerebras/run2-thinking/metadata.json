    "final_text": "To find the value of x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. The equation given is x + 5 = 12. \n\nWe can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation, which keeps the equation balanced. \n\nSo, x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5, which simplifies to x = 7.\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7.I'm happy to help you with your query.
