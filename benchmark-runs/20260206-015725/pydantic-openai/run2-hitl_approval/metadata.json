(files, folders, email, cloud storage, database records, account, etc.)\n2. Where is it stored? (Windows, macOS, Linux, Google Drive, Dropbox, AWS, SQL database, etc.)\n3. Do you have a backup or do you need help making one?\n4. Do you want a normal delete (recycle/trash) or a secure/irreversible wipe (overwriting)?\n5. Are you authorized to delete this data? (important for legal/accountability)\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, confirm you want me to proceed by typing one of these exact approval phrases:\n\n- For irreversible deletion: CONFIRM DELETE IRREVERSIBLE\n- For reversible deletion (trash/recoverable): CONFIRM DELETE RECOVERABLE\n\nAfter you send the exact phrase plus a short description of the target (for example: CONFIRM DELETE IRREVERSIBLE \u2014 delete folder /home/user/secrets), I will (1) repeat the exact action I will take, (2) show the specific commands or steps I recommend, and (3) ask one final confirmation before giving the delete commands."
