Before we move forward, I need a few details so I can give safe, correct instructions and ask for your confirmation exactly when needed:\n\n1. What exactly do you want to delete?\n   - Files/folders? (give full paths)\n   - Database rows/tables? (which DB type and exact table/rows)\n   - Cloud objects? (provider and bucket/container names)\n2. Environment and access:\n   - Operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux), or cloud/DB console?\n   - Do you have command-line access or will I provide a script/console steps?\n3. Deletion type:\n   - Soft delete (move to trash/archive) or permanent delete?\n   - Secure overwrite (shred) required?\n4. Backups and recovery:\n   - Do you have backups? Want me to create one or show how?\n5. Constraints or compliance:\n   - Any legal, regulatory, or retention requirements?\n6. Confirmation method:\n   - How would you like to approve when I\u2019m ready to perform deletion? (e.g., reply with the exact phrase \u201cYES, DELETE\u201d)\n\nOnce you provide the details above and choose a confirmation phrase, I\u2019ll prepare a clear plan and the exact commands/steps. I will then ask for your explicit approval using your chosen phrase before giving any irreversible deletion commands."
