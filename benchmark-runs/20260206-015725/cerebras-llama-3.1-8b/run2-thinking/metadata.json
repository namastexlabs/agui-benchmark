Our goal is to isolate x, which means we need to get x by itself on one side of the equation.\n3. To do this, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the +5 on the left side and keep the equation balanced.\n   x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n4. Simplifying both sides of the equation:\n   x = 7\n\nSo, the value of x is 7."
