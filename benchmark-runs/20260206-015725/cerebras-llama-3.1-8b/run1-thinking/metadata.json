Given equation: x + 5 = 12\n\nThe goal is to get x by itself. We can do this by getting rid of the +5 on the left side of the equation.\n\n2. To eliminate the +5, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\nx + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3. x = 7\n\nBy subtracting 5 from both sides, we've effectively \"canceled out\" the +5 on the left side of the equation, leaving x by itself."
