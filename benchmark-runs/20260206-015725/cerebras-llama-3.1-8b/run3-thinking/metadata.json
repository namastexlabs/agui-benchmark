    "final_text": "To solve for x in the equation x + 5 = 12, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the equation**: The equation x + 5 = 12 means that x (the variable) plus 5 equals 12.\n\n2. **Identify the goal**: Our goal is to find the value of x.\n\n3. **Isolate the variable (x)**: To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Since x is currently on the left side of the equation, we'll focus on the left side.\n\n4. **Subtract 5 from both sides**: To isolate x, we'll subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the +5 on the left side.\n\n   x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n   Simplify both sides:\n   x = 7\n\n5. **Check the solution (optional)**: To verify our answer, we can plug 7 back into the original equation:\n   7 + 5 = 12\n   This is true, so our solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
