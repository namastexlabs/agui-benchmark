What exactly do you want deleted? (file names, folders, or a description of the data)\n2. Where is it stored? (local PC \u2014 Windows/macOS/Linux, an external drive, a server, cloud provider and which one, database, etc.)\n3. Is there a backup you can restore from if needed? Do you want me to create or walk you through making a backup first?\n4. Do you need secure (irreversible, overwritten) deletion or a normal delete/trash?\n5. Do you have administrative access to the system, or will I provide commands for someone else to run?\n6. Any legal, compliance, or recovery concerns I should know about?\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, explicitly approve deletion by replying with a confirmation in this exact form (so I don\u2019t act on an ambiguous reply):\n\n\"I approve deletion of: [brief description]. I understand this action is irreversible.\"\n\nI will only proceed after I receive that exact confirmation. Would you like to provide the details above now?"
