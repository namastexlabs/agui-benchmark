Since x was being added to 5, I subtracted 5 from both sides, which isolated x and gave me x = 7. The verification confirms this is correct since 7 + 5 = 12.Perfect! \u2713\n\n**Answer: x = 7**\n\n**Reasoning:** To solve for x, I used the algebraic principle that whatever you do to one side of an equation, you must do to the other side to keep it balanced.
