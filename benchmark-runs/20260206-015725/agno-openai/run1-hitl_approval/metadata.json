Before we proceed, I need a few details and an explicit confirmation from you.\n\nPlease answer these questions:\n1. What exactly do you want deleted? (files, folders, a database, cloud storage bucket, email account, device, etc.)\n2. Where is the data located? (local machine path, server name/IP, cloud provider and bucket/container name, database name/table, etc.)\n3. Do you have a backup or do you want me to create one first? (If no backup, deletion may be irreversible.)\n4. Do you have authorization to delete this data? (I need you to confirm you\u2019re allowed to remove it.)\n5. Do you want a secure wipe (overwrite) or a normal delete? (Secure wipe is slower but harder to recover.)\n6. Any time constraints or other special instructions?\n\nWhen you\u2019ve answered the questions above, confirm you want me to proceed by typing the exact confirmation phrase:\nCONFIRM DELETE \u2014 I UNDERSTAND THIS IS IRREVERSIBLE\n\nI will not take any deletion steps until I receive that phrase."
