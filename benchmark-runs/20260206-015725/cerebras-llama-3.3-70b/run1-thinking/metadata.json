Our goal is to get x by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to get rid of the +5 that's being added to x.\n3. To get rid of the +5, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will keep the equation balanced.\n\nSo, we subtract 5 from both sides:\nx + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\nThis simplifies to:\nx = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
