I can't delete, modify, or access any of your information.\n\nIf you need to delete data from your own systems, I'd recommend:\n1. **Back up important data first** before deleting anything\n2. **Double-check what you're deleting** to ensure it's actually what you want to remove\n3. **Use your system's built-in tools** (file manager, database admin panel, etc.)\n4. **Keep records** of what was deleted and when, if it's important\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with, like calculations or telling you the time?"
