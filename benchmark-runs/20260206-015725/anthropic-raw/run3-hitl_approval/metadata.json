I can only:\n\n- Tell you the current date and time\n- Perform basic math calculations\n\nI don't have access to files, databases, accounts, or any systems where data is stored. So there's nothing for me to delete, and no approval process would be needed on my end.\n\nIf you're looking to delete data from your own systems, you'll need to:\n1. Use the appropriate application or service directly\n2. Follow that platform's deletion procedures\n3. Make sure you have proper backups if needed\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like calculating something or checking the time?"
