I can't take actions beyond these two functions.\n\nIf you're looking to delete data from your own system, device, or account, you would need to:\n1. Access that system directly yourself\n2. Use the appropriate deletion tools or settings within that application/platform\n3. Make sure you have proper backups before deleting anything important\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like doing some calculations or checking the time?"
