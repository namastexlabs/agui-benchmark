Use your operating system or application directly\n2. Contact your IT department or system administrator\n3. Use the appropriate software or platform where that data is stored\n\n**Important reminder**: Before deleting any important data, please make sure you have:\n- A recent backup\n- Confirmed with relevant stakeholders\n- Verified you're deleting the correct files/data\n- Checked any recovery options available to you\n\nIs there something else I can help you with?"
