Do you want me to create one first?\n- When should the deletion happen (now or scheduled)?\n- Any authorization or account I should use (I can\u2019t access your systems without credentials or integration)\n- Any legal/compliance constraints I should know about\n\nWhen you provide those details, I will repeat the exact action I plan and ask for one final confirmation before doing anything. To confirm, please reply with the exact phrase:\nCONFIRM DELETE\n\nIf you prefer, I can (a) prepare safe deletion commands/scripts for you to run, (b) outline the steps to create a backup, or (c) schedule deletion instructions.
