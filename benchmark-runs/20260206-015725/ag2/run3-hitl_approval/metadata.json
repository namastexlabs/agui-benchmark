(file paths, database name/tables, cloud bucket, account, etc.)\n- Where is it stored (local machine, server, cloud provider, NAS)?\n- Do you want permanent deletion (bypass trash/recycle) or move to trash/archive?\n- Do you have a backup or need instructions to create one?\n- Do you want me to provide commands/steps, or (if you give remote access) execute them?\n\nImportant: permanent deletion may be irreversible. I\u2019ll present a clear plan and the exact consequences. I will only proceed after you give an explicit confirmation using the following approval phrase exactly as shown:\n\nCONFIRM DELETE: [brief description of items to delete]\n\nExample you would send to approve: CONFIRM DELETE: /home/alice/old_project and S3 bucket mycompany-backup-2020\n\nShall I prepare the deletion plan now? If yes, give the details above."
