I can't delete, modify, or access any of your information.\n\nIf you're looking to delete data from your own systems, you would need to:\n1. Use the appropriate application or service directly\n2. Follow that platform's deletion procedures\n3. Ensure you have proper backups before deleting anything important\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like a calculation or checking the time?"
