Write down the equation: x + 5 = 12\n2. **My goal is to isolate x, which means I need to get x by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, I will subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This is because whatever operation I perform on one side of the equation, I must also perform on the other side to maintain the balance of the equation.\n\nSo, I will subtract 5 from both sides:\nx + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n1. Simplify both sides of the equation:\nx = 7\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 7."
