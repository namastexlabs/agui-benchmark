(file paths, folder names, database & table names, cloud bucket(s), device(s), etc.)\n2) Where is it stored? (local machine OS, server via SSH, cloud provider and service, database type, SaaS app)\n3) Do you have a backup or snapshot? If not, do you want help creating one before deletion?\n4) Do you want a safe (recoverable) delete or permanent/secure wipe (irreversible)?\n5) Any timeframe or downtime constraints?\n6) Are there legal, compliance, or business implications I should know about?\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, confirm in one clear message using this exact phrase (so I know it\u2019s intentional):\nYES \u2014 delete [brief description of what to delete]\n\nExample: YES \u2014 delete /home/me/old_backups and s3://my-bucket/old_backups\n\nI will wait for that exact confirmation before giving deletion commands or proceeding with any steps."
