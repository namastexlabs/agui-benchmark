(files, database rows, cloud storage, email, device)\n- Where is it located? (path, server, service, account)\n- Do you have a backup or snapshot? If not, do you want instructions to make one first?\n- Should the deletion be permanent (irrecoverable) or move to Trash/Archive first?\n- Any legal/ethical or compliance concerns I should know about?\n\n2) Risks (brief)\n- Deletion may be irreversible and could cause data loss, service outages, or legal issues. Make a backup if you might need recovery.\n\n3) How to confirm\nIf you want me to proceed after I provide steps, type one of these exact confirmation phrases:\n- For permanent deletion: DELETE PERMANENTLY\n- For move to Trash/Archive only: MOVE TO TRASH\n\nI will not proceed until you reply with one of those exact phrases. What do you want deleted, and which confirmation phrase will you use?"
