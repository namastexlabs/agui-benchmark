To do this, we need to get rid of the +5 on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.\n\n   x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n3. This simplifies to: x = 7\n\n   By subtracting 5 from both sides, we were able to get rid of the +5 and isolate x, which leaves us with just x on the left side of the equation.\n\nTherefore, x = 7."
