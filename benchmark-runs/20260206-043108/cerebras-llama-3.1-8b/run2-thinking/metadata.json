Our goal is to isolate x, so we want to get rid of the +5 on the left side of the equation.\n\n3. To do this, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the +5 on the left side.\n\n   x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n4. Simplifying both sides of the equation:\n\n   x = 7\n\n   Therefore, the value of x is 7."
