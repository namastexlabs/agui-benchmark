We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:\n- x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n\n**Step 3: Simplify**\n- x + 0 = 7\n- x = 7\n\n**Step 4: Verify the answer**\nLet's check: if x = 7, then 7 + 5 = 12 \u2713\n\n**Answer: x = 7**\n\nThe reasoning is based on the principle that if we perform the same operation (subtracting 5) on both sides of an equation, it remains balanced and true. This is how we isolate the variable to find its value."
