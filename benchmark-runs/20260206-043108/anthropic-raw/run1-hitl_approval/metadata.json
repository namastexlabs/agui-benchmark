I can't delete, modify, or access any of your files or information.\n\nIf you're looking to delete important data from your computer or a service, you would need to:\n1. Do that directly through your operating system, application, or service\n2. Make sure you have proper backups first\n3. Follow your organization's data handling procedures if applicable\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like a calculation or checking the time?"
