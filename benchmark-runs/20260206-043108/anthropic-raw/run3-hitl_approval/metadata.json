I'm a helpful assistant with access to only two tools:\n\n1. **Get current time** - tells you the date and time\n2. **Calculator** - performs basic math calculations\n\nI cannot access, modify, or delete files, databases, accounts, or any other data on your system or anywhere else.\n\nIf you're looking to delete important data, you should:\n- Use your system's native tools or applications\n- Contact your IT department or service provider for sensitive data deletion\n- Ensure you have proper backups before deleting anything important\n- Follow your organization's data retention and deletion policies\n\nIs there something else I can help you with, like a math calculation or checking the current time?"
