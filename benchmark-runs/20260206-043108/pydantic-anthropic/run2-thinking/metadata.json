Since 5 is being added to x, I'll subtract 5 from both sides:\n- x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\n- x = 7\n\n**Step 3: Verify the answer**\nLet me check: if x = 7, then 7 + 5 = 12 \u2713\n\nLet me also confirm this with a calculation:**Answer: x = 7**\n\nThe reasoning is straightforward: to solve for x, we perform the inverse operation. Since 5 is added to x, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to maintain equality. This gives us x = 12 - 5 = 7."
