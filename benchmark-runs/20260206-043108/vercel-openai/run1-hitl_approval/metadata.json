Before we proceed I need a few details and an unambiguous confirmation.\n\nPlease answer the following:\n\n1. What exactly do you want deleted? (names/paths/containers/databases/services \u2014 be as specific as possible.)\n2. Where is the data stored? (local disk, cloud provider + service, SaaS app, database type/version, etc.)\n3. Do you have a backup you want kept? If not, do you want me to create/export a backup first?\n4. Do you want permanent (secure overwrite) deletion or a soft delete (recoverable for some time)?\n5. Any compliance/legal concerns or retention requirements I should know about?\n6. When should the deletion occur? Now or scheduled time?\n7. Who should be notified after deletion and what report do you want?\n\nRequired explicit approval\n- If you understand the consequences and want me to proceed, type exactly (including the brackets replaced):\n\n  I APPROVE PERMANENT DELETION of [brief description of the data to delete]\n\nExample: I APPROVE PERMANENT DELETION of /home/alex/projects/secret.zip and the database reports.production\n\nI will not act until I receive that exact confirmation phrase. After you confirm I\u2019ll summarize the deletion plan and the steps I will take (backup, verification, deletion method, post-deletion verification and report) and then proceed."
