Before we proceed, I need some details and your clear, written confirmation.\n\n1) Quick checklist I need from you\n- Exactly what to delete (names, file paths, database/table names, buckets, etc.)\n- Where it is stored (local machine, specific server, cloud provider and region)\n- Desired deletion type: soft delete (move to trash/archive), permanent delete, or secure overwrite (irreversible)\n- Are there backups that must be preserved? Do you want a backup created first?\n- Any compliance or legal concerns I should know about (retention rules, audits)\n- Who else has access or ownership that must be notified/revoked\n- Preferred timeframe (now / scheduled)\n\n2) What I will do once you confirm\n- Provide a clear, step-by-step deletion plan and exact commands or UI steps\n- Explain consequences and how to recover (if possible)\n- Ask you to confirm one final time with an explicit confirmation phrase before any destructive steps\n- After you approve, I\u2019ll show the exact commands you can run \u2014 I will not run them myself\n\n3) Please confirm you want to proceed and provide the details above. Then type one of these exact confirmation phrases (copy/paste):\n- For permanent deletion: I confirm permanent deletion of [short description]\n- For soft delete / archive: I confirm soft deletion of [short description]\n\nReplace [short description] with the data name (e.g., \u201c/home/alice/important_folder\u201d or \u201ccustomer_db.production.orders\u201d).\n\nOnce you supply the details and the exact confirmation phrase, I\u2019ll give the precise deletion plan and commands."
